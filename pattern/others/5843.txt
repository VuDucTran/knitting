SOCK: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 60-70-70-80-90 sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with Fabel. K 1 round, P 1 round and K 1 round. Then work A-1 one time vertically. When A-1 has been worked, there are 48-56-56-64-72 sts on needle. Then work A-2 one time vertically. Now piece measures approx. 8 cm. Continue with A-3 until piece measures approx. 15-19-23-27-31 cm – finish after 1 round marked with arrow – AT THE SAME TIME on this last round, dec 4-8-6-6-8 sts evenly = 44-48-50-58-64 sts. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!
Then work A-4 – AT THE SAME TIME on last round, dec 4-0-2-2-8 sts evenly = 40-48-48-56-56 sts. Continue with A-5 one time vertically, then work 4 rounds in rib = K 1/P 1. Piece now measures approx. 22-26-30-34-38 cm. K 1 round while at the same time dec 0-4-0-4-2 sts evenly = 40-44-48-52-54 sts.
Now keep the first 19-21-23-25-25 sts on needle for heel and slip the remaining 21-23-25-27-29 sts on a stitch holder (= mid on top of foot).  
Work in stocking st over heel sts for 4-4-4½-5-5 cm. Insert a marker. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above! After heel dec, knit up 11-11-12-13-13 sts along each side of heel and slip the 21-23-25-27-29 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 56-58-64-68-70 sts. Insert a marker on each side of the 21-23-25-27-29 sts on top of foot. Then work A-6 over the middle 11 sts on top of foot and work the other sts in stocking st. AT THE SAME TIME dec in each side as follows: K tog the last 2 sts BEFORE marker mid on top of foot twisted (i.e. work in back loop of st instead of front) and K tog the first 2 sts AFTER last marker on top of foot. Repeat dec every other round a total of 7-6-9-9-8 times = 42-46-46-50-54 sts. When A-6 has been worked 2-2-2-3-3 times on top of foot, continue in stocking st over all sts. Continue until piece measures 11-13-14-16-18 cm from marker on heel (= approx. 3-3-4-4-4 cm remain). Insert a marker in each side so that there are 21-23-23-25-27 sts on upper foot and 21-23-23-25-27 sts under foot. Continue working in stocking st while AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes on each side of both markers - SEE DECREASE TIP!  
Repeat dec every other round a total of 3-2-6-5-4 times and then every round 5-7-3-5-7 times = 10 sts remain on needle. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.
