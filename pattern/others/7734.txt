--------------------------------------------------------

SLIPPER:
First work an edge at the top of slipper, then work foot before working a loose leg worked across that is sewn on at the end.

EDGE: 
Cast on 24-27-30-33-36-39-42 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with Eskimo. Work in GARTER ST in the round - see explanation above - until piece measures approx. 3-3-3-4-4-4-4 cm, finish after 1 round P. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION 

FOOT:
Keep the first 10-10-10-12-12-14-14 sts on round on needle and slip the remaining 14-17-20-21-24-25-28 sts on a stitch holder. Now work PATTERN - see explanation above - back and forth over the 10-10-10-12-12-14-14 sts (choose diagram for correct size). AT THE SAME TIME on first row cast on 1 new st in each side (= edge st, work this st in garter st) = 12-12-12-14-14-16-16 sts on row. When middle piece measures 4-4-5-6-6-7-8 cm, cast off 1 edge st in each side = 10-10-10-12-12-14-14 sts remain on row. Then slip the sts from stitch holder back on needle and pick up 6-6-8-9-9-11-12 sts on each side of middle part (inside 1 edge st) = 36-39-46-51-54-61-66 sts on needle. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE. Insert 1 marker mid front of toe (in the middle of the 10-10-10-12-12-14-14 sts on middle piece) and 1 marker mid back on heel – NOTE: In size with uneven no of sts insert marker in the middle st at the back. Continue in the round in garter st. When piece measures 2 cm - adjust so that next round is a round with K, dec each side of both markers - READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec like this every other round until piece measures 4-4½-5-5-5½-5½-6 cm – cast off the remaining sts. Sew seams under foot in outer loops of edge sts to avoid a chunky seam.

LOOSE LEG WORKED ACROSS: 
Cast on 16-16-16-18-18-18-18 sts on needle size 4 mm with Eskimo. Work 2 ridges in GARTER ST back and forth - see explanation above! Now work pattern according to A.2 – choose diagram for correct size. When piece measures approx. 18-20-22-24-26-28-30 cm - adjust after 1 row from WS, work 2 ridges over all sts before casting off with K from RS. Place cast-on edge over cast-off edge and sew on 3 buttons for decoration through the leg. Pull leg 2 cm down over edge on foot with buttons on the outside of slipper and sew leg to cast-on edge on slipper from WS with invisible stitches.
