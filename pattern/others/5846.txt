SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 42-45-45 (48-48-51) sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with Karisma. K 1 round, then work rib (= K 1/P 2) for 3 cm. K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 6 sts evenly = 36-39-39 (42-42-45) sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and work diagram A.1. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 12-14-15 (16-17-18) cm, keep the first 20-23-23 (23-23-26) sts on needle for heel and slip the last 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts on a stitch holder (= mid on top of foot) - NOTE: Displace sts on needle with one st to the right or left so that sts on top of foot beg and ends with 1st st in A.1 (i.e. K 1). Work in stocking st back and forth over heel sts for 4-4½-4½ (5-5-5) cm. Insert a marker in the piece. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above! After heel dec, knit up 9-10-10 (11-11-11) sts on each side of heel and slip the 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts from stitch holder back on needle = 42-47-47 (52-52-53) sts. Insert a marker on each side of the 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts on top of foot. Continue in the round with A.1 over the 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts on top of foot and in stocking st over the remaining sts - AT THE SAME TIME on 1st round dec in each side as follows: K the last 2 sts before the 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts on top of foot tog and K the first 2 sts after the 16-16-16 (19-19-19) sts twisted tog. Repeat dec every other round 3-3-3 (4-4-4) more times = 34-39-39 (42-42-43) sts. Continue to work until piece measures 10-11-13 (14-16-18) cm from marker on heel (approx. 3-4-4 (4-4-4) cm remain until finished measurements). K 1 round over all sts while AT THE SAME TIME dec 0-1-1 (0-0-1) sts on round = 34-38-38 (42-42-42) sts. Now insert a marker in each side so that there are 17-19-19 (21-21-21) sts both on top of foot and under foot. Continue in stocking st over all sts. AT THE SAME TIME on next round dec 1 st on each side of both markers for toe - SEE DECREASE TIP! Repeat dec every other round 2-3-3 (2-2-2) more times, then every round a total of 2-2-2 (4-4-4) times = 14 sts remain on needle. On next round K all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining 7 sts, tighten tog and fasten.
