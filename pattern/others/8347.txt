BLANKET:  
Blanket it worked from tail fin and upwards. First worked in the round on circular needle, divide the piece on the tail and work back and forth onwards.

TAIL FIN: 
Cast on 110-116-124-130-136-142 stitches on circular needle size 8 mm with 2 strands light blue. Cut one strand and continue working with only 1 strand.
Work in PATTERN - see explanation above. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! 
When piece measures 25-26-28-29-30-31 cm, knit all stitches together 2 by 2 = 55-58-62-65-71 stitches. Tail fin is now done. 
Cut the yarn.

TAIL:
Switch to medium purple. Now continue working in stocking stitch and on first round decrease 21-20-20-19-18-15 stitches evenly on round = 34-38-42-46-50-56 stitches. Insert a marker and measure from here. Work 2 cm in stocking stitch. On next round increase 1-2-3-4-5-4 stitches evenly on round = 35-40-45-50-55-60 stitches. Work in stocking stitch until piece measures 4 cm. Insert 5 marker threads evenly on round. Switch to a long circular needle when needed.
READ THE REST OF THE PATTERN BEFORE CONTINUING!
Now increase alternately before and after each of the marker threads by making 1 yarn over (= 5 stitches increased each time) on every 3rd-4th-4th-5th-5th-5th cm, increase 10-11-11-12-12-13 times in total, work the yarn overs twisted on next row/round to avoid holes. After last increase there are 85-95-100-110-115-125 stitches on needle. 
AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 25-27-29-31-33-35 cm divide the pieces for a slit on the start of the round = mid back. Work the first and last 5 stitches in GARTER STITCH - see explanation above, and rest of the stitches are worked in stocking stitch as before. 
When piece measures 64-78-92-106-122-136 cm work 6 cm with garter stitch over all stitches until piece measures 70-84-98-112-128-142 cm. Cast off and fasten the yarn.

ASSEMBLY:
Fasten the strands. Sew the vent at the bottom of tail together along the bottom 5 cm or as long up the tail as you want. Place tail double with vent in the middle of piece. Sew tail fin together along cast-on edge.
