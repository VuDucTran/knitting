INCREASE TIP:
Increase on each side of knit 2 by making 1 yarn over. On next round work yarn overs twisted to avoid holes. Work the increased stitches in rib, i.e. knit the first 2 stitches increased, and purl the next 2 stitches etc.

DECREASE TIP:
Decrease like this before marker: Knit 2 stitches twisted together/ Purl 2 stitches twisted together. 
Decrease like this after marker: Knit 2 stitches together/ Purl 2 stitches together.

KNITTING TIP:
Leg length can be adjusted to desired measurements. By working the legs longer they can be folded up and grow along with the child.
----------------------------------------------------------

PANTS:
Worked in the round, top down. Round starts mid back.
Cast on 104-112-120-120-128-136 stitches on circular needle size 4.5 mm with 1 strand of each colour (= 2 strands). Insert 1 marker at beginning of round (= mid back) and 1 marker after 52-56-60-60-64-68 stitches (= mid front). Work rib from mid back as follows: Knit 1, * purl 2, knit 2 *, repeat from *-* until 3 stitches remain on round and finish with purl 2 and knit 1. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures approx. 2 cm, work a round with eyelet holes as follows: Knit 1, * purl 2 together, 1 yarn over, knit 2 *, repeat from *-* until 3 stitches remain on round, finish with purl 2 together, 1 yarn over and knit 1. Continue with rib as before. When piece measures 5 cm, work an elevation at the back as follows: Work 7 stitches rib, turn, tighten yarn and work 14 stitches rib back. Turn, tighten yarn and work 24 stitches rib. Turn, tighten yarn and work 34 stitches rib. Continue like this by working 10 stitches more on every turn until a total of 74-74-94-94-114-114 stitches have been worked. Turn piece again. Continue in the round over all stitches again (knit 2/purl 2) until piece measures 15-16-17-18-19-20 cm mid front. On next round, increase 1 stitch on each side of the middle 2 stitches at the front and back – read INCREASE TIP! Increase like this every other round 8 times in total = 136-144-152-152-160-168 stitches. When piece measures 22-23-24-25-26-27 cm from mid front, cast off 12 stitches mid front and mid back (cast off 6 stitches on each side of both markers). Finish each leg piece separately. Slip the stitches for one leg on 1 stitch holder. 

LEG: 
= 56-60-64-64-68-72 stitches. Distribute the stitches on double pointed needles size 4.5 mm. Insert 1 marker on the inside of leg - round begins here. Then continue rib with knit over knit and purl over purl. When leg measures 2 cm, decrease 1 stitch on each side of marker - read DECREASE TIP (= 2 stitches decreased). Decrease like this every 2-2-2-2-3-3 cm 6 times in total = 44-48-52-52-56-60 stitches. When leg measures approx. 31-38-44-50-58-66 cm - read KNITTING TIP, loosely cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl.
Slip stitches from the other leg back on double pointed needles and work as first leg.
