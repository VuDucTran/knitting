Worked in the round on circular needle and then on double pointed needles.

On next round, dec 1 st after every marker by K 2 tog. Repeat dec every 3rd-2nd round 4-6 more times and then every 4th round 4 times = 9 sts remain on needle. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts and tighten tog. The hat measures approx. 20-22 cm vertically.

Count 12 sts from mid back and out to one side - insert a marker. Pick up with wine red on needle size 3.5 mm: 1 st in each of the next 22-26 sts along cast on edge.

Continue in stocking st as follows: A-2 (= 3 sts), A-1 – choose diagram for size (= 17-19-21 sts), A-2 (= 3 sts) and then A-3 over the last 17-19-21 sts – beg A-3 at arrow for desired size.
