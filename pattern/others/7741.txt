RIGHT MITTEN:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 34-36-38-42 sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with light grey. Work 2 ridges in GARTER ST - see explanation above. Switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and work pattern in the round according to diagram A.1. After A.1 continue with light grey until finished measurements. Continue in the round in stocking st. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When piece measures 6-7-8-9 cm, K 1 round while dec 4-4-4-6 sts evenly = 30-32-34-36 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work rib in the round = K 1/P 1 for 3-3-4-4 cm. After rib mitten measures 9-10-12-13 cm. Switch back to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and work in stocking st. When 3-5-5-7 rounds in stocking st after rib have been worked, beg inc for thumb gusset and inc 1 st on each side of second st on round – READ INCREASE TIP. Inc like this every other round 3-3-4-4 times in total (inc on each side of all thumb sts, i.e. thumbs sts inc by 2 sts after every YO). After all inc are done, there are 7-7-9-9 thumb sts and 36-38-42-44 sts in total on needle. When mitten measures 12-13½-16-17½ cm (piece measures approx. 3-3½-4-4½ cm from rib) slip the 7-7-9-9 thumb sts on 1 stitch holder. Cast on 1 new st behind sts on stitch holder = 30-32-34-36 sts on needle. Continue in the round in stocking st. When mitten measures 17-18-21-23 cm (piece measures approx. 8-8-9-10 cm from rib), insert 1 marker in each side (= 15-16-17-18 sts between markers). On next round dec 1 st on each side of both markers – READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec like this every other round a total of 4 times and then every round 2 times in total = 6-8-10-12 sts remain on needle. On next round K tog all sts 2 by 2 = 3-4-5-6 sts remain. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. Mitten measures approx. 20-21-24-26 cm.

THUMB:
Slip the 7-7-9-9 sts from stitch holder over thumb gusset back on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and pick in addition up 5 new sts with light grey in the edge behind the thumb sts = 12-12-14-14 sts. Work in stocking st in the round for 3-3½-4-4½ cm. On next round K tog all sts 2 by 2 = 6-6-7-7 sts remain. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.
