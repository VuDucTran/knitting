TIGHTS: 
Worked in the round, top down. Rounds start mid back.
Cast on 160-168-176-184-192 sts on circular needle size 2.5 mm with Baby Merino. Insert a marker at beg of round (= mid back) and a marker after 80-84-88-92-96 sts (= mid front). Work rib from mid back as follows: K 1, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-*, finish with P 2, K 1. When piece measures 5 cm, work an elevation at the back as follows: Work 11 sts in rib, turn, tighten thread, work 22 sts in rib on return, turn, tighten thread, work 32 sts in rib. Continue like this by working 10 sts more on every turn until a total of 122-142-142-162-162 sts have been worked. Turn, continue in the round over all sts. Work as follows from mid back: K 1, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 28-32-32-36-36 sts, P 2, A.1 – see diagram for size, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 60-68-68-76-76 sts, finish with P 2, A.1, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 28-32-32-36-36 and finish with P 2, K 1. Continue this pattern. When piece measures 18-19-20-21-22 cm mid front, inc 1 st on each side of the middle 2 sts mid front and back – see INCREASE TIP. Repeat inc every other round a total of 12 times = 208-216-224-232-240 sts. When piece measures 25-26-27-28-29 cm, cast off 16 sts mid front and mid back. Finish each leg separately, slip sts for one leg on a stitch holder. 

LEG: 
= 88-92-96-100-104 sts. Distribute sts on 4 double pointed needles size 2.5 mm and continue rib with cables in the side - insert a marker on the inside of leg. When leg measures 2 cm, dec 1 st on each side of marker - READ DECREASE TIP. Repeat dec every 4-4-5-5-6 cm a total of 8 times = 72-76-80-84-88 sts. AT THE SAME TIME when leg measures 30-36-42-50-58 cm, work rib K 2/P2 over all sts. When leg measures 38-44-50-58-66 cm, loosely cast off with K over K and P over P. 

Slip sts from the other leg back on needle and work as first leg. 

ASSEMBLY: 
Sew the 16 sts that were cast off between the legs tog towards each other. Fold the 2 cm at the top of tights double towards WS and fasten with neat little stitches, leaving a small opening to thread the elastic through.
