Remember your knitting tension! When piece measures 8-9-10 cm knit 1 row from the right side and 1 row from the wrong side and finish the hat in stocking sts. At the same time when the piece measures 13-14.5-16 cm (adjust so that next row is from the right side) insert 5 marking threads in piece as follows: 1 st, insert a marking thread, *8-9-10 sts, 1 marking thread*, repeat from *-* a total of 4 times (after the last marking thread there are 7-8-9 sts left on row). Now dec 1 st to the left of all marking threads by K 2 tog on every other row 4 times and on every row 2-3-4 times (from the wrong side dec by P2 tog to the right of each marking thread) = 10 sts left. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts and sew tightly. The hat measures approx 19-21-23 cm. Sew together the hat mid back in the outer loop of sts to ensure the seam doesn’t become too heavy.
