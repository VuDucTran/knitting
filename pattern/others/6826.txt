SOCK: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. Cast on 50-50-55-55-60-65 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with 1 strand off white and 1 strand red or grey (= 2 strands). K 2 rounds, then work rib = K 2/P 3. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 13-16-18-20-22-24 cm, dec all 3 P sts to 2 P sts = 40-40-44-44-48-52 sts. Continue with rib K 2/P 2 until piece measures 22-25-27-29-31-33 cm. Now keep the first 18-18-18-18-22-22 sts on needle for heel (the first 2 and last 2 sts of this are K sts) and slip the last 22-22-26-26-26-30 sts on 1 stitch holder (= mid on top of foot). Work in stocking st back and forth over heel sts for 5-5-5-5-5½-6 cm, AT THE SAME TIME on 1st row dec 0-0-0-0-2-0 sts evenly = 18-18-18-18-20-22 sts. Insert 1 marker – now measure piece from here. Then dec for heel - SEE HEEL DECREASE! After heel dec, pick up 10-10-10-10-11-12 sts on each side of heel and slip the 22-22-26-26-26-30 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 52-52-56-56-58-66 sts. Insert 1 marker on each side of the 22-22-26-26-26-30 sts on top of foot. Then continue rib over sts on top of foot, work the other sts in stocking st - AT THE SAME TIME dec in each side as follows: K the last 2 sts before sts on top of foot twisted tog (i.e. in back loop of st instead of front), K the first 2 sts after sts on top of foot tog. Dec like this every other round 10-9-10-8-7-9 times = 32-34-36-40-44-48 sts. Work rib over 22-22-26-26-26-30 sts on top of foot and in stocking st over 10-12-10-14-18-18 sts under foot until piece measures 14-16-18-20-22-24 cm from marker on heel (= 4-4-4-4-5-6 cm remain). 
Now insert 1 marker in each side so that there are 16-17-18-20-22-24 sts both on top of foot and under foot. Continue working stocking st - AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes on each side of both markers. 
Dec as follows when 3 sts remain before marker: 
K 2 tog, K 2 (marker is between these sts), K 2 twisted tog. Dec in each side every other round 3-3-3-3-4-5 times in total and then every round 3-3-3-4-4-4 times = 8-10-12-12-12-12 sts remain on needle. On next round work all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. Knit another sock the same way. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
