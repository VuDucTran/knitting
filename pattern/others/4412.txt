RIGHT SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 56-60-64-68 sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with Fabel. K 2 rounds and continue in rib P2/K2 until piece measures 4-4-5-5 cm. Now continue in rib on the first 26-30-30-34 sts and stocking st on remaining sts. Continue like this until piece measures 11-13-15-17 cm. Now keep the first 26-30-30-34 sts on needle for heel and slip the remaining 30-30-34-34 sts on a stitch holder = upper foot.
Work rib back and forth on heel sts for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker, and now measure piece from here. Dec for heel - see HEEL DEC. After heel dec pick up 12-13-14-16 sts each side of heel and slip the 30-30-34-34 sts from upper foot back on needle = 68-74-80-86 sts. Insert a marker each side of the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot.  Continue in stocking st on all sts, AT THE SAME TIME dec each side as follows: K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot and K tog the first 2 sts after the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 10-10-12-12 times = 48-54-56-62 sts. When piece measures 15-17-19-21 cm from marker on heel (4-5-5-6 cm remain) slip the 24-27-28-31 sts from upper foot on a stitch holder and the 24-27-28-31 sts under foot on another stitch holder.

DEC FOR TOES:
Slip 17-19-20-22 sts (on right side of piece as seen from the leg of sock towards the toes) from stitch holder on upper foot and 17-19-20-22 sts from stitch holder under foot (on the same side) back on needle = 34-38-40-44 sts. Cast on 5 new sts towards sts on stitch holders = 39-43-45-49 sts. Insert a marker each side with 20-22-23-25 sts on upper foot and 19-21-22-24 sts under foot. Continue in stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes each side of both markers (= 4 dec) as follows: 
Dec as follows before marker: K2 tog. Dec as follows after marker: K2 tog into back of loop. Dec 1 st each side of marker towards big toe on every 4th round 4-5-5-6 times and dec 1 st each side of marker towards the side on every other round 8-10-10-12 times = 15-13-15-13 sts left on needle.
Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten. 

BIG TOE:
Slip the remaining 7-8-8-9 sts from stitch holder on upper foot and the remaining 7-8-8-9 sts from stitch holder under foot back on needle. Pick up 5 sts towards the dec for toes = 19-21-21-23 sts. Work stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME after approx 1 cm inc 3 sts evenly = 22-24-24-26 sts. Continue in stocking st until big toe measures approx 4-5-5-6 cm. Now K2 tog all the way round = 11-12-12-13 sts. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
