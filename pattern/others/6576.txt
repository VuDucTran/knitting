OWL HAT:
Hat is worked from bottom up. Beg by working ear flaps as follows: Cast on 3 sts on double pointed needles size 7 mm with light blue, work in GARTER ST - see explanation above, back and forth on needle - AT THE SAME TIME on first row (= RS) inc 1 st in each side by making a YO inside edge st = 2 sts inc. Repeat inc on every other row from RS 4-4-4-5-5-5 more times (= 5-5-5-6-6-6 times in total) = 13-13-13-15-15-15 sts on needle. Continue to work in garter st until piece measures approx. 8-9-10-10-10-11 cm. Put piece aside, work another ear flap the same way and make sure to finish on the same row on both ear flaps. Cast on 4-5-6-4-4-5 new sts on circular needle size 7 mm with light blue (= back of hat), then work one ear flap on to needle, make sure that ridges fit. Cast on 18-18-18-18-19-19 new sts (= at the front of hat), work next ear flap on to needle (make sure that ridges fit here as well) and cast on 4-5-6-5-5-5 new sts on needle (= back of hat) = 52-54-56-57-58-59 sts on needle. Put piece tog and work in the round, P 1 round, K 1 round and P 1 round. Then work in stocking st. When piece measures 8-9-9-10-10-11 cm, switch to blue/violet and work until piece measures 14-15-16-17-17-18 cm. On next round, dec 0-0-0-1-0-1 sts evenly = 52-54-56-56-58-58 sts on needle. Insert a marker in each side of piece, first marker after 13-13-14-14-15-15 sts from beg of round and second marker 13-14-14-14-14-14 sts before beg of round (= 26-27-28-28-29-29 sts on each side of markers). Continue in stocking st and inc AT THE SAME TIME at each marker every other round to make an ear in each side as follows: Work until 1 st before marker, make a YO, work 2 sts (marker is between these 2 sts), make another YO. On next round K YOs twisted to avoid holes. Repeat inc 2 more times (= 3 times in total) = 64-66-68-68-70-70 sts on needle. Finish with 1 round K without inc, then work until first marker so that opening in the piece is in the side. Insert sts on a stitch holder and place hat flat so that markers are in each side. Sew tog with grafting/kitchener sts and make sure that sts are the same size or somewhat bigger to make the edge elastic.
