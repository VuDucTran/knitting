PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 to A.5. Choose diagram for your size. The whole pattern is worked in stocking stitch.

DECREASE TIP-1:
To work out how to decrease evenly, count the total number of stitches on the needle (e.g. 52 stitches) and divide by the number of decreases to be made (e.g. 4) = 13. 
In this example, knit every 12th and 13th stitch together.

DECREASE TIP-2:
Decrease as follows before the marker: Start 2 stitches before the marker and knit 2 together. 
Decrease as follows after the marker: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch.

KNITTING TIP (for heel):
To strengthen the heel you can use 2 strands when working heel and heel decreases as follows: Use the strand from the inside and outside of the ball and work 1 stitch alternately with the one then the other strand. In this way, you get a slightly thicker heel without using a double strand.

HEEL DECREASE:
ROW 1 (= right side): Work until there are 6-6-6-8-8 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch, turn the piece.
ROW 2 (= wrong side): Work until there are 6-6-6-8-8 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over the purled stitch, turn the piece.
ROW 3 (= right side): Work until there are 5-5-5-7-7 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch, turn the piece. 
ROW 4 (= wrong side): Work until there are 5-5-5-7-7 stitches, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over the purled stitch, turn the piece. 
Continue to decrease in the same way, by working until there is 1 less stitch before slipping 1 stitch and until there are 10-10-10-10-10 stitches left on the needle.
--------------------------------------------------------

SOCK:
The piece is worked in the round with double pointed needles, top down.
Cast on 48-52-56-60-64 stitches with double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and rose. Knit 1 round, then work rib in the round (= knit 2 /purl 2). When the rib measures 2-2-3-3-3 cm knit 1 round where you decrease 0-4-2-6-4 stitches evenly on round – read DECREASE TIP-1 = 48-48-54-54-60 stitches. Continue by working A.1 in the round (= 8-8-9-9-10 repeats of 6 stitches). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! On the round marked with arrow-1 in A.1 decrease 0-0-2-2-2 stitches evenly = 48-48-52-52-58 stitches. 
The next round is worked as follows: Work A.2A (= 3 stitches), work A.2B over the next 42 stitches (= 3 repeats of 14 stitches) and finish with A.2C (= 3-3-7-7-13 stitches). Continue the pattern in this way. On the round marked with arrow-2 in A.2B decrease 8-8-4-4-2 stitches evenly on round = 40-40-48-48-56 stitches. When A.2 has been completed, work A.3 in the round (= 5-5-6-6-7 repeats of 8 stitches). On the round marked with arrow-3 in the diagram, decrease 0-0-8-0-8 stitches evenly = 40-40-40-48-48 stitches. When A.3 has been completed, work A.4 in the round (= 5-5-5-6-6 repeats of 8 stitches). Continue A.4 until piece measures 18-19-20-20-22 cm. Now keep the first 10-10-10-12-12 stitches on the needle for the heel, place the next 20-20-20-24-24 stitches on a 1 thread (= mid top of foot) and keep the last 10-10-10-12-12 stitches on the needle for heel. Read KNITTING TIP and work stocking stitch back and forth with dark rose over the 20-20-20-24-24 heel stitches for 4-4-4-5-5 cm. Insert 1 marker in the middle of the row – THE PIECE IS NOW MEASURED FROM HERE! 
Continue by working HEEL DECREASE – see description above! After the heel decrease, knit up 9-9-9-11-11 stitches on each side of the heel and the 20-20-20-24-24 stitches from the thread are placed back on the needle = 48-48-48-56-56 stitches on the needle. Continue with A.4 in the round as before until A.4 has been worked a total of 2-2-2-3-3 times in height (from where A.4 started). Then work stocking stitch with dark rose.
AT THE SAME TIME on the first round after you have knitted up stitches on each side of the heel, decrease in each side as follows: Knit together the first 2 stitches after the 20-20-20-24-24 stitches on top of foot and knit twisted together the last 2 stitches before the 20-20-20-24-24 stitches on top of foot. Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 4-4-4-6-6 times = 40-40-40-44-44 stitches (when decreasing there will not be enough stitches to fit a hole repeat of A.4 in each side, adapt the pattern by working more stitches with dark rose between the “dots” in each side). Continue in the round until the piece measures 8-10-11-13-15 cm from the marker on the heel, there are now approx. 7 cm before finished length. Work A.5 in the round (= 10-10-10-11-11 repeats of 4 stitches). When A.5 has been completed, work stocking stitch with dark rose to finished length. When the piece measures 11-13-14-16-18 cm from the marker on the heel, insert 1 new marker in each side so that there are 20-20-20-22-22 stitches both on top of and underneath the foot. Continue with stocking stitch in the round - AT THE SAME TIME decrease 1 stitch on each side of both markers for toe - read DECREASE TIP-2. Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 5 times in all sizes and then every round a total of 2 times in all sizes = 12-12-12-16-16 stitches left on the needles. On the next round, knit all the stitches together 2 and 2 = 6-6-6-8-8 stitches left. Cut the strand, pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten and fasten well. Work one more sock in the same way. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
