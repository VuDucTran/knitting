MAGIC CIRCLE:
To avoid hole in the middle beg with this technique: 
Hold yarn end in the left hand and make a loop around left index finger (from left to right). Hold the loop with left thumb and index finger. Insert needle through loop, get yarn from ball (i.e. place yarn 1 time over needle from you), pull yarn back through loop, 1 YO (now place yarn from the back and towards you) and pull YO through sts on needle, * insert needle through loop, 1 YO (place yarn from the back and towards you), pull YO through loop, 1 YO (from the back and towards you) and pull YO through outermost st on right needle (i.e. the last st made) *, repeat from *-* until there are 14 sts on needle. Distribute sts on 4 double pointed needles size 3 or 3.5 mm as explained in pattern.
Then work as explained in pattern – AT THE SAME TIME pull yarn end so that loop is tighten tog and the hole disappears.

BERET:
Work in the round on double pointed needles, switch to circular needle when needed.
Start with Karisma and MAGIC CIRCLE - see explanation above = 14 sts. Distribute sts on 4 double pointed needles size 3 or 3.5 mm with 4 sts on each of the first 3 needles and 2 sts on last needle. Work pattern in the round according to diagram A.1 (= 7 repetitions of 2 sts). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When 1 round remain in A.1, there are 112 sts on needle. Switch to circular needle size 2.5 or 3 mm and continue rib in the round as shown in last round of A.1. When rib measures 4-5 cm, cast off with K over K and P over P (make sure to avoid a tight cast-off edge). Have you made this or any other of our designs?
