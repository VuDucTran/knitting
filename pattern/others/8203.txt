----------------------------------------------------------

HAT:
Worked in the round on circular needle, switch to double pointed needles when needed. 
Cast on 84-88-90-96 stitches on circular needle size 4 mm with Air. Work 1 round in stocking stitch. Then work rib (= purl 1/knit 1) for 4 cm. Then work as follows: Work A.1 (= 17 stitches that are increased to 22 stitches), then work rib as before over the remaining stitches = 89-93-95-101 stitches on needle. Then work as follows: Work A.2 over the first 22 stitches, work in stocking stitch over the next 67-71-73-79 stitches, at the same time adjust number of stitches over these 67-71-73-79 stitches to 65-72-77-80 on first round = 87-94-99-102 stitches. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 15-16-17-18 cm, insert 5-6-7-8 markers in the piece as follows: Insert first marker thread in 23rd stitch on round, then insert the remaining marker threads 12-11-10-9 stitches apart. On next round, decrease 1 stitch after every stitch with marker thread – read DECREASE TIP (= 5-6-7-8 stitches decreased). Decrease like this every other round a total of 3 times, then every round a total of 3 times. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 15-16-17-18 and 18-19-20-21 cm, purl the outermost 2 stitches in each side of A.2 together = 53-54-53-50 stitches. * Knit 1 round, on next round knit together all stitches 2 by 2* = 27-27-27-25 stitches on needle. Repeat from *-* one more time = 14-14-14-13 stitches remain on needle. On next round knit all stitches together 2 by 2 = 7 stitches left in all sizes. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten together and fasten. Hat measures approx. 20-21-22-23 cm from top and down.

POMPOM:
Make a pompom with an approx. of diameter 4-6 cm and fasten it at the tip of the hat.

SCARF:
Work piece back and forth on needle.
Cast on 22-26-30 stitches on needle size 5 mm with Air. Work in GARTER STITCH - see explanation above, until piece measures approx. 120-135-150 cm or desired length. Cast off and fasten the yarns.
