SOCK: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles from the top down. Cast on 52-52-56-64 sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with red. K 1 round and continue in rib, P2/K2. When rib measures 4-5-5-6 cm K 1 round, AT THE SAME TIME dec 4-4-8-4 sts evenly = 48-48-48-60 sts. Change to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm. K 1 round with off-white and now work M.1 on all sts (= 4-4-4-5 repeats across the round). After 1 vertical repeat of M.1 keep the first 12-12-13-15 sts on needle, slip the next 24-24-22-30 sts on a stitch holder (= mid upper foot) and keep the last 12-12-13-15 sts on needle = 24-24-26-30 sts for heel. Work stocking st back and forth on needle on heel sts with red for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker. Now work HEEL DECREASES – see above! After heel dec pick up 10-10-12-10 sts each side of heel and slip the 24-24-22-30 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 52-52-56-60 sts.
Insert a marker each side of the 24-24-24-32 sts mid upper foot.
Continue in the round in stocking st and M.2 as follows:
M.2 on the 24-24-24-32 sts mid upper foot, 4 stocking sts in off-white, M.2 on the next 20-20-24-20 sts (= under foot), 4 stocking sts in off-white.
AT THE SAME TIME dec each side of heel as follows: K tog the first 2 sts after the 24-24-24-32 sts on upper foot and K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 24-24-24-32 sts on upper foot. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 4 times = 44-44-48-52 sts. Now continue in M.2 on all sts until piece measures approx 15-18-20-22 cm from marker on heel (= approx 4-4-4-5 cm remain). K 1 round in off-white on all sts.
Now insert 1 marker each side with 22-22-24-26 sts on upper foot and under foot. Continue in the round in red stocking st on all sts. AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes on each side of both markers as follows, beg 3 sts before marker: K2 tog, K2 (marker sits between these 2 sts), K2 tog into back of loop. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 3-3-3-4 times and then on every round a total of 6-6-7-7 times = 8 sts left on needle. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
