MITTEN: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles in stocking st. Cast on 28-32-36 sts with red Alaska on 2 double pointed needles size 5.5 mm. Remove one needle and work in stocking st while AT THE SAME TIME working STRIPES - see explanation above. When piece measures 7-8-9 cm, inc 4 sts evenly = 32-36-40 sts. When piece measures 13-15-17 cm, work next round as follows: Work 5-6-7 sts, slip these 5-6-7 sts on a stitch holder for thumb, work the remaining sts. On next round, cast on 5-6-7 new sts over thumb sts on the stitch holder. Continue in the round in stocking st. When piece measures 8-11.5-14 cm from thumb opening, dec 4 sts evenly on every other round 5 times, then on every round a total of 1-2-3 times = 8 sts remain on needle. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. The entire mitten measures approx. 26-31-36 cm.

THUMB: 
Slip sts from stitch holder back on needle, knit up 5-6-7 sts behind opening and 1 st in each side = 12-14-16 sts. Work in stocking st in the round while AT THE SAME TIME working stripes to fit the stripes on the hand. When thumb measures 5.5-6.5-8.5 cm, work all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.

Knit another mitten the same way.

CROCHET BORDER:
Crochet on hook size 6 mm and Puddel around the opening on the mitten. Work * 1 dc, 2 ch, skip 1 cm *, repeat from *-* and finish with 1 sl st in 1st dc. 

FELTING: 
Place a small plastic (sandwich) bag inside the thumb to avoid felting the tip tog. Secure it with a safety pin. Place the mittens in the washing machine with a detergent without enzymes and optical bleach. Wash at 40 degrees with normal spin but no pre-wash. After wash shape the mittens to the right measurements while still wet and leave to dry flat. At subsequent wash, wash the mittens at regular wool programme.
