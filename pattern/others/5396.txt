Continue with K 2/P 3 for 1 cm. On next round start inc for thumb gusset in the first K-section on round. Make 1 YO between the first 2 K sts, on next round K YO twisted to avoid holes. The new st = thumb st. Work 1 round with K over K and P over P. On next round inc 1 st on each side of thumb st – inc by making 1 YO which is K twisted on next round (i.e. work in back loop of st). Repeat inc every 3rd round a total of 4-5-6 times (inc on both sides of all thumb sts) = 9-11-13 thumb sts – work all inc sts in stocking st. When piece measures a total of 10-12-14 cm, slip the 9-11-13 thumb sts + 1 sts on each side of these on a stitch holder. Cast on 2 new sts behind sts on stitch holder = 45-50-55 sts on needle. Continue rib as before. When piece measures 15½-17½-20½ cm in total, dec all 3 P sts to 2 P sts = 36-40-44 sts. Work 1 round without dec. Then dec all 2 P sts to 1 P st = 27-30-33 sts. Work 1 round without dec, then dec all 2 K sts to 1 K st = 18-20-22 sts. On next round K all sts tog 2 by 2 = 9-10-11 sts. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. The mitten measures approx. 17-19-22 cm in total.
