Cast on 44-48-52 (56-60-68) sts with Karisma on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm. Work 12-13-14 (16-17-18) cm Rib. Work next round as follows: 22-26-26 (30-30-34) sts in Rib – start and finish with P2 (= mid upper foot) and 22-22-26 (26-30-34) sts in stocking st for heel. Work 4-4.5-5 (5-.5-6-6.5) cm stocking st back and forth on needle over heel sts. Insert a marking thread in the middle heel st and now measure piece from here. 
Now dec for heel as follows: 
1st row (= RS): Work row until 7-7-8 (8-9-10) sts remain, slip next st as if to K, K1, psso, turn the piece.
2nd row (= WS): Work row until 7-7-8 (8-9-10) sts remain, slip next st as if to P, P1, psso, turn the piece.
3rd row: Work row until 6-6-7 (7-8-9) sts remain, slip next st as if to K, K1, psso, turn the piece.
4th row: Work row until 6-6-7 (7-8-9) sts remain, slip next st as if to P, P1, psso, turn the piece.
5th row: Work row until 5-5-6 (6-7-8) sts remain, slip next st as if to K, K1, psso, turn the piece.
Continue dec like this with 1 less st on each row from RS before  each dec until there are 10-10-12 (12-14-16) sts left on row. Now pick up 10-11-12 (13-14-15) sts on each side of the heel = 52-58-62 (68-72-80) sts. Continue in the round with Rib on the upper 22-26-26 (30-30-34) sts and stocking st on remaining sts. At the same time, dec as follows: K tog the last 2 sts before the Rib and work the 2 first sts after the Rib as follows: slip 1 st as if to knit, K1, psso. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 6-7-9 (10-10-12) times = 40-44-44 (48-52-56) sts. Continue in Rib and stocking st as before.

Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 5-6-6 (7-8-9) times = 20 sts left on round. On next round work all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the thread and pull it though remaining sts.
