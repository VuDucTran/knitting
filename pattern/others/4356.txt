Worked in the round on needle from the bottom towards the top (change to double pointed needles when sts no longer fit circular needle).

REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures approx 15-19-21-21 cm insert 9-8-9-8 markers in piece with 11-13-12-14 sts between each. Now dec 1 st before each marker by K2 tog and repeat the dec on every 3rd round a total of 5 times = 54-64-63-72 sts. Then dec 4-6-5-5 sts evenly on every 3rd round a total of 8-7-8-10 times = 22-22-23-22 sts on needle. Work 2 rounds stocking st and now K2 tog across the round = 11-11-12-11 sts. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts and fasten. Hat measures approx 34-37-41-44 cm.

POMPOM:
Make a pompom with a diameter of approx 8 cm in off-white. Attach the pompom to the top of hat. 

FELTING:
Wash the hat in washing machine at 40 degrees with detergent free of enzymes and optical bleach (usual spin and no pre-wash). After wash try the hat on when it’s still wet to make sure it’s the right size. If the hat is too large after felting, you may wash it again. If the hat is too small, soak it and pull it into the right size. 
At subsequent washes wash hat at a wool programme.

Fold the edge approx 3 to 5 cm towards RS.
