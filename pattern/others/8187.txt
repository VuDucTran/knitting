Work next round as follows: * Purl 6, knit the next 10 stitches and increase AT THE SAME TIME 2 stitches over these 10 stitches *, work from *-* 5-5-6-6 times in total = 90-90-108-108 stitches. Then work as follows: * Purl 6, A.2 (= 12 stitches) *, work from *-* 5-5-6-6 times in total. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 15-16-17-18 cm, decrease 1 stitch at the beginning of every purl section, decrease by purling 2 together (= 5-5-6-6 stitches decreased, A.2 continue as before). Repeat decrease every cm but decrease alternately at the end and beginning of purl section, 5 times in total = 65-65-78-78 stitches. Then knit 1 round while decreasing 4 stitches over every A.2 = 45-45-54-54 stitches remain on needles. On the next 2 rounds knit all stitches together 2 by 2 = 12-12-14-14 stitches remain on needles.
