MONK'S COWL:
Work from bottom up. 
Cast on 324-348-372 sts on circular needle size 2.5 mm (60 cm) with Delight. Work 4 rounds in rib = K 2/P 2. Work next round as follows: * K 2, P 2, P 2 tog, P 2, P 2 tog, P 2 *, repeat from *-* the entire round = 270-290-310 sts. Continue with * K 2, P 8 *. At the same time on 3rd-4th-5th round, dec 1 st in every P-section by P the last 2 P sts tog, repeat dec every 3rd-4th-5th round until only 2 P sts remain in every P-section – NOTE: Dec alternately at the beg and end of every P-section (switch to a shorter circular needle when there are too few sts for the long one) = 108-116-124 sts. Piece measures approx. 7-8-10 cm. Work K 2/P 2 for 3-4-5 cm. On next round, inc all 2 P sts to 3 P sts = 135-145-155 sts. Work 2 rounds with K 2/P 3. On next round, cast off the first 12 sts for opening for face. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE! Then work back and forth on circular needle until finished measurements. AT THE SAME TIME cast off 1 st at beg of every row 7 times in each side = 109-119-129 sts remain on needle. Continue rib with 1 st in garter st in each side for approx. 16-18-20 cm (from where the first 12 sts were cast off), finish after 1 row from WS. Continue with upper piece.

UPPER PIECE: 
Work 1 row in rib as before (from RS) and cast on 37 new sts at the end of row = 146-156-166 sts. Work 1 round over all sts as follows: P 1, * K 2, P 3 *, repeat from *-* until 3 sts remain before the new sts, K 2, P 1, then work the new sts as follows: * K 2, P 3 *, repeat from *-*, and finish with K the last 2 sts (i.e. the rib does not work out in the transitions between upper piece and the rest of the cowl, this will not be visible because of dec). Now work back and forth over the new sts while at the same time dec sts from each side, i.e. work as follows: Turn piece, * work back from WS until 1 st remains of the new sts, then P 2 tog. Turn piece, slip first as if to K, work until 1 st remains of the new sts, slip this st as if to K, K 1 and psso. Turn piece, slip first st as if to P *, repeat from *-* until 38-43-48 sts have been dec in each side. 70 sts now remain on needle and the rib works out the entire round in K 2/P 3. Continue with the tail.

TAIL: 
Now continue in the round on double pointed needle over all sts – insert a marker in the middle of the 2 K sts at the beg and end of upper piece. When 3-3-4 rounds have been worked, dec 1 st on each side of both markers – SEE DECREASE TIP, repeat dec every 4th-4th-5th round a total of 15 times = 10 sts remain on needle. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. Tail measures approx. 17-17-21 cm.

EDGE AROUND FACE: 
Knit up 130-140-150 sts on a short circular needle size 2.5 mm inside 1 edge st around the opening of cowl – NOTE: Along the upper piece knit up 2 sts over the 2 K sts and 2 sts over the 3 P sts. Then work rib = K 2/P 2 (make sure that K and P sts match on top of each other at the top of upper piece) for approx. 5-6-7 cm, cast off with K over K and P over P. Fold the rib double towards WS and fast in the knit up-edge. 

POMPOM: 
Make a dense pompom with a diameter of approx 4-5 cm and fasten at the tip of the tail.
