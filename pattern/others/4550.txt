SOCK: 
Worked in the round from top of leg down. Cast on 52-56-56-64 sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with dark mustard. K 1 round and continue in rib, P2/K2. When rib measures 4-5-5-6 cm K 1 round, AT THE SAME TIME dec 4-8-8-4 sts evenly = 48-48-48-60 sts. Change to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm. Continue in M.1 on all sts (= 4-4-4-5 repeats across). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! After M.1 keep the first 24-24-24-30 sts on needle for heel and slip the remaining 24-24-24-30 sts on a stitch holder (= mid upper foot). Work stocking st back and forth on heel sts in dark mustard for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker in heel.  Now work HEEL DECREASES – see above! 
After heel dec pick up 10-11-12-13 sts each side of heel and slip the 24-24-24-30 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 54-56-58-68 sts. Insert a marker each side of the 24-24-24-30 sts mid upper foot. Continue in the round in stocking st and M.2, AT THE SAME TIME dec 1 st each side as follows: K tog the first 2 sts after the 24-24-24-30 sts on upper foot and K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 24-24-24-30 sts on upper foot. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 5-4-5-8 times = 44-48-48-52 sts. When sock measures approx 15-18-20-22 cm from marker on heel (= approx 4-4-4-5 cm remain) insert a marker each side with 22-24-24-26 sts on upper foot and under foot. On next round dec for toes each side of both markers as follows: 3 sts before marker: K2 tog, K2 (marker sits between these 2 sts), K2 tog into back of loop. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 3-3-3-4 times and then on every round a total of 6-7-7-7 times = 8 sts left on needle. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
