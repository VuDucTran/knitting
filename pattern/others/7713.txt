MITTENS:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 32-36-40 sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with beige. Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 4-5-6 cm. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work 1 round in stocking st while at the same time inc 4-4-8 sts evenly = 36-40-48 sts. Continue with diagram A.1. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION
When 3 rounds in A.1 have been worked, beg inc for thumb gusset – inc on each side of second st on round – inc by making 1 YO, on next round K YOs twisted to avoid holes for thumb gusset. Work thumb gusset according to A.2. Repeat inc every 4th round 2-3-3 more times (inc on each side of all thumb sts, i.e. 2 sts inc between each YO). After all inc are done, there are 7-9-9 thumb sts and 42-48-56 sts in total on needle. 
When piece measures a total of 10-12-14 cm, slip the 7-9-9 thumb sts + 1 st on each side of these on 1 stitch holder. Cast on 3 new sts behind sts on stitch holder = 36-40-48 sts on needle. When A.1 has been worked one time vertically, work with beige, on first round inc 0-2-0 sts evenly = 36-42-48 sts.
AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 15-17-19 cm, insert 6 markers in the piece, 6-7-8 sts apart. On next round, dec 1 st after every marker by K 2 tog. 
Repeat dec every other round 2 more times and then every round 2-3-4 times = 6 sts remain on needle. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts and tighten tog. 
Mitten measures approx. 17-19-22 cm.

THUMB: 
Slip the 9-11-11 sts from stitch holder over thumb gusset back on double pointed needles size 3 mm, knit in addition up 5 sts with beige in the edge behind the thumb sts = 14-16-16 sts. Work in stocking st in the round with beige for 3½-4½-5½ cm. On next round, K all sts tog 2 by 2, cut the strand, pull it through the remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
