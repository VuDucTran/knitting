RIGHT MITTEN:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 36-36-40-44 sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with cerise. K 1 round. Then work rib = K 2/P 2 for 6-7-8-8 cm. K 1 round while at the same time dec 6-4-6-8 sts evenly = 30-32-34-36 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and work pattern in the round according to diagram A.1. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When 3-5-5-7 rounds with pattern have been worked, beg inc for thumb gusset and inc 1 st on each side of second st on round – READ INCREASE TIP (work inc sts in cerise). Inc like this every other round 3-3-4-4 times in total (inc on each side of all thumb sts, i.e. thumbs sts inc by 2 sts after every YO). After all inc are done, there are 7-7-9-9 thumb sts and 36-38-42-44 sts in total on needle. When mitten measures 9-10½-12-12½ cm (piece measures approx. 3-3½-4-4½ cm from rib) slip the 7-7-9-9 thumb sts on 1 stitch holder. Cast on 1 new st behind sts on stitch holder = 30-32-34-36 sts on needle. Continue pattern in the round. When mitten measures 12-13-15-16 cm, work as follows with red until finished measurements. When mitten measures 14-15-17-18 cm (piece measures approx. 8-8-9-10 cm from rib), insert 1 marker in each side (= 15-16-17-18 sts between markers). On next round dec 1 st on each side of both markers – READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec every other round as follows a total of 4 times and then every round 2 times in total = 6-8-10-12 sts remain on needle. On next round K tog all sts 2 by 2 = 3-4-5-6 sts remain. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. Mitten measures approx. 17-18-20-21 cm. 

THUMB:
Slip the 7-7-9-9 sts from stitch holder over thumb gusset back on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and pick in addition up 5 new sts with cerise in the edge behind the thumb sts = 12-12-14-14 sts. Work in stocking st in the round for 3-3½-4-4½ cm. On next round K tog all sts 2 by 2 = 6-6-7-7 sts remain. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.
