DROPS STRAIGHT NEEDLES SIZE 5 mm - or size needed to get 16 sts x 32 rows in garter st with 1 thread Big Fabel or 2 threads Fabel = 10 x 10 cm.SHORT ROWS:
More rows are worked over the bottom sts than the top sts. This is done as follows (1st row = RS):
* Work until 1st marker, turn and work back, work until 2nd marker, turn and work back, work until 1st marker, turn and work back, work 2 rows over all sts *, repeat from *-*. I.e. 1 repetition = 8 rows (4 ridges) at the bottom and 2 rows (1 ridge) at the top.

INCREASE TIP: 
Inc 1 st inside outermost st from bottom edge by making 1 YO, on next row K YO twisted (i.e. work in back loop of st instead of front) to avoid holes.
