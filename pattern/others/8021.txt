INCREASE TIP: 
Increase on each side of 2 knitted stitches by making 1 yarn over, on the next row knit the yarn overs twisted (in the back of the stitch loop). The increased stitches are worked in to the rib as you go, i.e. the first 2 stitches increased are knitted, the next 2 are purled and so on. 

DECREASE TIP: 
Work until there are 2 stitches left before the marker, then knit 2 together and knit 2 twisted together (work in the back of the stitch loops). 
---------------------------------------------------------

TIGHTS: 
The piece is worked in the round, from the top down. The round starts mid back.

Cast on 152-168-168-184-184 stitches with circular needle size 2.5 mm and Baby Merino. Insert 1 marker at the beginning of the round (= mid back) and 1 marker after 76-84-84-92-92 stitches (= mid front). Work rib as follows from mid back: knit 1, * purl 2, knit 2 *, repeat from *-*, finish with purl 2, knit 1. When the piece measures 5 cm, work an elevation in the back as follows: Work 11 stitches rib, turn, tighten the strand, work back 22 stitches rib, turn, tighten the strand, work 32 stitches rib. Continue in this way by working 10 more stitches each time you turn until a total of 122-142-142-162-162 stitches have been worked. Turn, then work in the round over all stitches, continue with rib until the piece measures 8 cm mid front. Work as follows – from mid back: knit 1, * purl 2, knit 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 24-28-28-32-32 stitches, purl 2, A.1 (= 22 stitches), * purl 2, knit 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 52-60-60-68-68 stitches, finish with purl 2, A.1, * purl 2, knit 2 *, repeat from *-* over the next 24-28-28-32-32 stitches and finish with purl 2, knit 1. Continue with this pattern. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 28-30-32-34-36 cm mid front increase 1 stitch on each side of the 2 middle stitches front and back – SEE INCREASE TIP! Repeat the increases every 2nd round a total of 12 times = 200-216-216-232-232 stitches. When the piece measures 35-37-39-41-43 cm cast off 16 stitches mid front and mid back. Each leg is finished separately. Place the stitches from the one leg on 1 thread. 

LEG: 
= 84-92-92-100-100 stitches. Divide the stitches on to 4 double pointed needles size 2.5 mm and continue with rib with lace pattern in the side - insert 1 marker on the inside of the leg. When the leg measures 2 cm, decrease 1 stitch on each side of the marker – READ DECREASE TIP. Repeat the decreases every 4 -4 -5 -5 -5 cm a total of 4 times = 76-84-84-92-92 stitches. AT THE SAME TIME when the leg measures 14-16-18-20-22 cm - adjust to a whole or half report of A.1 in height - work rib, knit 2/purl 2, over all stitches. Work rib for 1 cm then work A.2 over all the purl 2 stitches, all knit 2 stitches are continued as before. When A.2 has been worked 1 time in height there are 152-168-168-184-184 stitches on the round. Loosely cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl.  

Place the stitches from the other leg back on the needle and work in the same way as the first leg.
