----------------------------------------------------------

PANTS:
Worked top down in the round on circular needle and then on double pointed needles. Cast on 120-124-128-132 sts on a circular needle size 3 mm with red and work rib K 2/P 2. Work until rib measures 3 cm. Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work in stocking st AT THE SAME TIME on first round dec 12 sts evenly = 108-112-116-120 sts on needle. Insert 1 marker at beg of round = mid back. Work 1 more round but stop round 5 sts before marker. Put piece aside. Now work 5-5-7-7 small triangles to be worked in at the back of pants (= comb). 

TRIANGLES: Cast on 2 sts on a double pointed needle size 4 mm with red, K 1, 1 YO, K 1. Always work YO K twisted on next row to avoid hole. K all sts = 3 sts. Work in GARTER ST – see explanation above, back and forth on double pointed needles AT THE SAME TIME inc 1 st by making a YO inside 1 edge st in each side every 3rd row until there are 9 sts in total and 2 YOs on needle, P next row, P YOs twisted. There are now 2 rows in stocking st at the top of triangle. Put triangle on a stitch holder. Work 5-5-7-7 triangles in total and slip all on the same stitch holder. Make sure they are the same way, so that all have 2 rows in stocking st towards the same side. 
Now work them in at the back of pants.
Hold stitch holder with triangles towards RS of pants, make sure that the 2 rows in stocking st on triangles are towards you. Work first st from first triangle tog with first st from pants. Continue to work tog sts from triangle and pants until 3-3-4-4 triangles have been worked. Continue to work on pants until 22-22-33-33 sts before first triangle.
Then work the last 2-2-3-3 triangles in on pants. 
K the next 5 sts = beg of round/mid back, move marker from earlier down here. Switch to mustard and insert 1 more marker on pants, insert this after 54-56-58-60 sts (= mid front). Then work an elevation at the back in stocking st as follows: Work 8 sts past marker mid back, turn, tighten yarn and work 16 sts, turn, tighten yarn and work 24 sts, turn, tighten yarn and continue like this by working 8 sts more on every turn until a total of 80-80-80-96-96 sts have been worked. Turn, continue in stocking st in the round until piece measures 13-13-14-15 cm. Put piece aside.
Now work a large triangle (= beak) that is worked in mid back of pants the same way as the small triangles at the top. 

LARGE TRIANGLE: Cast on 2 sts on circular needle size 4 mm (40 cm) with red, K 1, 1 YO, K 1. K all sts = 3 sts. Work in garter st, back and forth on circular needle  AT THE SAME TIME inc 1 st with a YO inside 1 edge st in each side on every row 24-25-26-27 times = 51-53-55-57 sts on needle. On last row P sts and P YO twisted. There are now 2 rows in stocking st at the top of triangle. Place triangle to the side and continue in the round on pants until 25-26-27-28 sts before marker mid back. Hold triangle towards RS of pants, make sure that the 2 rows in stocking st on triangle are towards you. Work first st from triangle tog with first st from pants. Continue to work tog sts from triangle and pants until all sts on triangle have been worked, continue on pants until mid back.. 

Continue in stocking st until piece measures 18-18-20-21 cm mid front. Then inc 2 sts front and back on next round – READ INCREASE TIP! Repeat inc every other round 5 more times (= 6 times in total) = 132-136-140-144 sts. After last inc (piece measures approx. 23-23-24-25 cm mid front), cast off 12 sts mid front and mid back (i.e. cast off 6 sts on each side of both markers). Finish each leg separately, slip sts for one leg on 1 stitch holder. 

LEG: 
= 54-56-58-60 sts. Distribute sts on 4 double pointed needles size 4 mm and continue in stocking st in the round - insert 1 marker on the inside of leg. Work in stocking st until piece measures 4 cm, now work 2 rounds with off white AT THE SAME TIME dec 1 st on each side of marker – READ DECREASE TIP. Continue with mustard and repeat dec and 2 rounds with off white every 2.5-4.5-5.5-7 cm 5 more times (= 6 times in total) = 42-44-46-48 sts. When leg measures 19-28-34-40 cm, switch to red and work 2 rounds – AT THE SAME TIME on last round inc 6-8-6-8 sts evenly = 48-52-52-56 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work rib = K 2/P 2 with red for 10 cm. Then loosely cast off with K over K and P over P. Slip sts from the other leg back on needle and work as first leg.

ASSEMBLY: 
Sew the 12 sts cast off between legs, towards each other in outer loops of edge sts to avoid a chunky seam.
