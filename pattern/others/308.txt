Knitting tension: 21 sts x 28rows on needles size 4mm in stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm. 
Garter sts (back and forth on needle): knit all rows.
Garter sts (round on double pointed needles): knit 1 round, purl 1 round.
Pattern: 
M.2: in stocking sts
M.1: in garter sts, i.e. 1 row in diagram = 2 rows of garter sts
M.1: On earflaps, i.e. cut and sew the thread after each stripe.

Earflap: Cast on 5 sts on needle size 4mm with grey. Knit garter sts and M.1 – see explanation above. After 2 rows in garter sts inc 1 st each side from the right side by making a yo within 2 sts. On next row purl the yo into back of st to avoid creating a hole. Inc on every 4th row a total of 8-9-10 times = 21-23-25 sts. Continue in garter sts until earflap measures 8-9-10 cm (if M.1 finishes before finished measurements, continue in the colour from the last stripe). Put the piece aside and knit another earflap. 
Hat: Put one earflap on needle size 4mm. Cast on 14-16-18 new sts with the last colour in M.1 (= back) and put the other earflap on needle = 56-62-68 sts. Knit 4 rows garter sts over all sts, at the same time inc 1 st each side as described for earflap on every other row 2 times = 60-66-72 sts. On next row change to off-white and cast on 28-30-32 new sts between earflaps at the front = 88-96-104 sts. Measure piece from here from now on! Continue round on double pointed needles size 4mm, knit 4 rounds garter sts over all sts, cut the thread and begin new rounds mid back. Now finish the hat in stocking sts and M.2. Remember your knitting tension! At the same time when the piece measures 13 cm dec 3-1-4 sts evenly on round = 85-95-100 sts. Now insert 5 marking threads in piece with 17-19-20 sts between each thread and dec on every other round by knitting tog 2 sts to the right of all marking threads. NB: If dec are made on rounds in pattern, dec in the base colour and not the pattern colour. Continue to dec until there are 10 sts left, cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts and sew. The hat measures approx 24-25-26 cm from mid front to the top.

Now inc 1 st within each marking thread on every other round a total of 3-3-4 times = 11-11-13 thumb sts. When piece measures 3-4-4 cm put the thumb sts on a thread. Cast on 3 new sts behind the thumb sts = 36-40-44 sts and continue in stocking sts. When piece measures 6-7.5-9 cm knit next round as follows: 14-16-17 sts (= upper hand), put 8-8-10 sts on thread for little finger, knit 14-16-17 sts (= palm of hand). Now knit the fingers on double pointed needles size 2.5mm with grey.
