SLIPPER:
Cast on 24-27-30-33-36-39-42 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with Eskimo. Work in GARTER ST in the round - see explanation above - until piece measures approx. 3-3-3-4-4-4-4 cm, finish after 1 round P. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION 
Keep the first 8-9-10-11-11-12-12 sts on round on needle and slip the remaining 16-18-20-22-25-27-30 sts on a stitch holder. Now work in GARTER ST back and forth - see explanation above, over the 8-9-10-11-11-12-12 sts - AT THE SAME TIME on first row cast on 1 new st in each side (= edge st, work these in garter st) = 10-11-12-13-13-14-14 sts. When middle piece measures 4-4-5-6-6-7-8 cm, cast off 1 edge st in each side = 8-9-10-11-11-12-12 sts remain on row. Then slip the sts from stitch holder back on needle and pick up 6-6-8-9-9-11-12 sts on each side of middle part (inside 1 edge st) = 36-39-46-51-54-61-66 sts on needle. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE. Insert 1 marker mid front of toe (in the middle of the 8-9-10-11-11-12-12 sts on middle piece – NOTE: In size with uneven no of sts insert marker in the middle st) and 1 marker mid back. Continue in the round in garter st. When piece measures 2 cm - adjust so that next round is a round with K, dec each side of both markers - READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec like this every other round until piece measures 4-4½-5-5-5½-5½-6 cm – cast off the remaining sts. Sew seams under foot in outer loops of edge sts to avoid a chunky seam.
