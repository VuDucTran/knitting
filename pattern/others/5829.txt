PANTS:
Worked in the round, top down. Rounds start mid back.
Cast on 112-120-120-128-136 sts on circular needle size 4.5 mm with 1 thread Big Fabel or 2 threads Fabel. Insert a marker at beg of round (= mid back) and a marker after 56-60-60-64-68 sts (= mid front). Work rib from mid back as follows: K 1, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* the entire round and finish with P 2 and K 1. When piece measures approx. 2 cm, work a round with eyelet holes as follows: K 1, * P 2 tog, 1 YO, K 2 tog, 1 YO *, repeat from *-* the entire round, finish with P 2 tog, 1 YO and K 1. Continue with rib as before. When piece measures 5 cm, work an elevation at the back as follows: Work 7 sts rib, turn, tighten thread and work 14 sts rib on return, turn, tighten thread and work 24 sts rib, turn, tighten thread and work 34 sts rib on return. Continue like this by working 10 sts more on every turn until a total of 74-94-94-114-114 sts have been worked. Turn, continue in the round over all sts again until piece measures 16-17-18-19-20 cm mid front. On next round, inc 1 st on each side of the middle 2 sts at the front and back – SEE INCREASE TIP! Repeat inc every other round 7 more times = 144-152-152-160-168 sts. When piece measures 23-24-25-26-27 cm mid front, cast off 12 sts mid front and mid back (i.e. cast off 6 sts on each side of both markers). Finish each leg separately, slip sts for one leg on a stitch holder. 

LEG: 
= 60-64-64-68-72 sts. Distribute sts on 4 double pointed needles size 4.5 mm and continue in rib - insert a marker on the inside of leg. When leg measures 2 cm, dec 1 st on each side of marker - READ DECREASE TIP. Repeat dec every 2-2-2-3-3 cm, 5 more times = 48-52-52-56-60 sts. When leg measures 38-44-50-58-66 cm, loosely cast off with K over K and P over P. NOTE: Continue to work if longer leg length is desired.
Slip sts from the other leg back on needle and work as first leg.
