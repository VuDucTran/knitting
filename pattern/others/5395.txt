Continue in stocking st but work 1 st in each side K on every row. When piece measures approx. (11-12-12) 13-14-15-15 cm (adjust so that next row is worked from RS), K the first (8-8-8) 9-9-9-9 sts before slipping them on a stitch holder (for button strap), then cast off the next (2-2-2) 2-2-3-3 sts, work the rest of row. Turn piece and cast off the first (10-10-10) 11-11-12-12 sts = (36-38-40) 42-44-46-50 sts remain on needle. Continue in stocking st until finished measurements – AT THE SAME TIME dec 1 st at the beg of every row (2-2-3) 3-3-3-3 times in each side = (32-34-34) 36-38-40-44 sts. When piece measures (18-21-24) 27-29-31-34 cm in total, K all sts tog 2 by 2 from RS. Work 1 row without dec, then K all sts tog 2 by 2 one more time = (8-9-9) 9-10-10-11 sts remain. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts and tighten tog.   

BUTTON STRAP:
Slip the (8-8-8) 9-9-9-9 sts from stitch holder back on needle size 5 mm. (On the slipper with stripes, work the entire button strap with grey.)
