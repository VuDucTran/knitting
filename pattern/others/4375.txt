SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 56-60-64-68 sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with Delight. K 2 rounds and continue in rib, K2/P2, until piece measures 4-4-5-5 cm. Now continue in rib on the first 26-30-30-34 sts (the first and last 2 sts = K) and work remaining sts in stocking st. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 20-21-22-23 cm keep the first 26-30-30-34 sts on needle for heel and slip remaining 30-30-34-34 sts on a stitch holder = upper foot. Continue back and forth on heel-sts in rib for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker in heel – now measure piece from here! Now dec for heel – see HEEL DECREASES. After heel dec pick up 12-13-14-16 sts each side of heel and slip the 30-30-34-34 sts from upper foot back on needle = 68-72-78-84 sts. Insert a marker each side of the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot. Continue in stocking st on all sts,  AT THE SAME TIME dec each side as follows: K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot, and K tog the first 2 sts after the 30-30-34-34 sts on upper foot. Dec like this on every other round a total of 10-10-11-12 times = 48-52-56-60 sts. Continue until piece measures 15-18-19-22 cm from marker on heel (= 4-4-5-5 cm remain). Insert a marker each side with 24-26-28-30 sts on upper foot and under foot. Continue in stocking st, AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes each side of both markers as follows: 
Before marker: K2 tog. After marker: K2 tog into back of loop. Repeat the dec each side on every other round a total of 4-4-7-6 times and then on every round 5-6-4-6 times = 12 sts left on needle. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts and fasten.
