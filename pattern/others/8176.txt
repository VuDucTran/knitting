RIDGE/GARTER STITCH (worked in the round):
1 ridge = 2 rounds. Knit 1 round and purl 1 round.

PATTERN:
See diagrams A.1 and A.2.
----------------------------------------------------------

HAT:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, bottom up. Change to double pointed needles when necessary. Cast on 112-112-120 stitches with circular needle size 3.5 mm and Merino Extra Fine. Work rib (= knit 2 / purl 2) for 4 cm. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and work as follows: * A.1 (= 2 stitches), purl 6 *, work from *-* a total of 14-14-15 times. Continue the pattern in this way. When A.1 has been completed one time in height, continue working in the same way with A.2 over each A.1 = 126-126-135 stitches. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 16-17-18 cm decrease 1 stitch at the beginning of each purl section, by purling 2 stitches together = 112-112-120 stitches. Continue the decreases every cm, but decrease alternately at the end and beginning of the purl section a total of 5 times upwards = 56-56-60 stitches. On the next round, knit all stitches together 2 and 2 = 28-28-30 stitches. Knit 1 round, then knit all stitches together again, 2 and 2 = 14-14-15 stitches. 
Cut the strand, pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten and fasten well. The hat measures approx. 21-22-23 cm in height.

POM POM:
Make a pom pom of approx. 4-6 cm in diameter and fasten to top of hat.

NECK WARMER:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, top down. Cast on 88-96-104 stitches with circular needle size 3.5 mm and Merino Extra Fine. Work rib (= knit 2 / purl 2) for 11-12-13 cm. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and work as follows: * A.1 (= 2 stitches), purl 6 *, work from *-* a total of 11-12-13 times. When A.1 has been completed one time in height, continue in the same way with A.2 over each A.1 = 99-108-117 stitches. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 14-15-16 cm increase 1 stitch at the beginning of each purl section, increase 1 stitch by making a yarn over, the yarn over is purled twisted on the next round so you do not get a hole. Continue the increases every 3rd round, but increase alternately at the end and beginning of the purl section a total of 5 times = 154-168-182 stitches. When the piece measures 20-22-24 cm work 2 RIDGES over all stitches, then cast off with knit.

CROCHET EDGE:
Crochet an edge around the bottom of the neck warmer with hook size 3.5 mm and Merino Extra Fine as follows: Work 1 double crochet in the first stitch, * 3 chain stitches, work 1 treble crochet in the first chain stitch worked, skip approx. 1½ cm, work 1 double crochet in the next stitch *, work from *-* to end of round, finish with 1 slip stitch in the first double crochet.
