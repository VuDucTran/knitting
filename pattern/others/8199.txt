Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comINFORMATION FOR THE PATTERN:

INCREASE TIP:
Increase on each side of 2 knitted stitches by making 1 yarn over. On the next round work the yarn overs twisted to prevent holes. The increased stitches are worked into the rib as you go, i.e. the first 2 stitches which are increased are knitted, the next 2 are purled, etc.

DECREASE TIP:
Decrease like this before marker: Knit 2 stitches twisted together/ Purl 2 stitches twisted together. 
Decrease like this after marker: Knit 2 stitches together/ Purl 2 stitches together.

KNITTING TIP:
Leg length can be adjusted to desired length. By working the legs longer, they can be turned up and the trousers can grow with the child.
----------------------------------------------------------

TROUSERS:
The piece is worked in the round, top down. The round starts mid back.
Cast on 104-112-120-120-128-136 stitches with circular needle size 4.5 mm and 2 strands Fabel. Insert 1 marker at the beginning of the round (= mid back) and 1 marker after 52-56-60-60-64-68 stitches (= mid front). Work rib as follows from mid back: * Purl 3, knit 1 *, repeat from *-* to end of round. 
When the piece measures 2 cm work a row of holes as follows: * Purl 1, purl 2 together, 1 yarn over, knit 1 *, work from *-* to end of round = 26-28-30-30-32-34 holes on the round. After the row of holes continue with rib as before with purl 3/ knit 1 for 2 more rounds. 
The next round is worked as follows: Knit 1, * purl 2, knit 2 *, work from *-* until there are 3 stitches left on the round, finish with purl 2 and knit 1. Continue with rib in this way. 
When the piece measures 5 cm work an elevation at the back of the trousers as follows: Work 7 stitches rib, turn, tighten the strand and work 14 stitches rib back. Turn, tighten the strand and work 24 stitches rib. Turn, tighten the strand and work 34 stitches rib back. Continue back and forth in this way by working 10 more stitches each time you turn until you have worked over a total of 74-74-94-94-114-114 stitches, turn the piece. Continue by working rib in the round over all stitches again with knit 2/ purl 2 until the piece measures 15-16-17-18-19-20 cm from the cast-on edge mid front. On the next round, increase 1 stitch on each side of the middle 2 stitches in front and back - read INCREASE TIP! Increase in this way every 2nd round a total of 8 times = 136-144-152-152-160-168 stitches. When the piece measures 22-23-24-25-26-27 cm from the cast-on edge mid front, cast off 12 stitches mid front and mid back (i.e. cast off 6 stitches on each side of both markers). Each leg is finished separately. Place the stitches around one leg on 1 thread. 

LEG:
= 56-60-64-64-68-72 stitches. Divide the stitches onto double pointed needles size 4.5 mm. Insert 1 marker on the inside of the leg – the round starts here. Continue rib with knit over knit and purl over purl. When the leg measures 2 cm from the marker, decrease 1 stitch on each side of the marker – read DECREASE TIP (= 2 stitches decreased). Decrease in this way every 2-2-2-2-3-3 cm a total of 6 times = 44-48-52-52-56-60 stitches. When the leg measures approx. 31-38-44-50-58-66 cm – read KNITTING TIP, loosely cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl. 
Place the stitches from the other leg on double pointed needles and work in the same way as the first leg.
