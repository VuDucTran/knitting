SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 68-68-68 (68-68-68) sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm with Karisma. Work diagram A-1. When diagram A-1 has been worked 1 time vertically, there are 60-60-60 (60-60-60) sts on needle. K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 24-21-21 (18-18-15) sts evenly = 36-39-39 (42-42-45) sts. Work next round as follows: * K 2 tog, 1 YO, K 1 *, repeat from *-* the entire round. Then work in stocking st. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 10-11-12 (13-14-15) cm, keep the first 18-21-21 (21-21-23) sts on needle for heel and slip the remaining 18-18-18 (21-21-22) sts on a stitch holder (= mid on top of foot). Work in stocking st back and forth over heel sts for 4-4½-4½ (5-5-5) cm. Insert a marker in the piece. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above! After heel dec, knit up 9-10-10 (11-11-11) sts on each side of heel and slip the 18-18-18 (21-21-22) sts from stitch holder back on needle = 44-49-49 (54-54-55) sts. Insert a marker on each side of the 18-18-18 (21-21-22) sts on top of foot. Continue in the round in stocking st over all sts - AT THE SAME TIME dec in each side as follows: K the last 2 sts before the 18-18-18 (21-21-22) sts on top of foot tog and K the first 2 sts after the 18-18-18 (21-21-22) sts twisted tog. Repeat dec every other round 4-4-4 (5-5-5) more times = 34-39-39 (42-42-43) sts. Continue to work until piece measures 10-11-13 (14-16-18) cm from marker on heel (approx. 3-4-4 (4-4-4) cm remain until finished measurements). K 1 round over all sts while AT THE SAME TIME dec 0-1-1 (0-0-1) sts on round = 34-38-38 (42-42-42) sts. Now insert a marker in each side so that there are 17-19-19 (21-21-21) sts both on top of foot and under foot. Continue in stocking st over all sts. AT THE SAME TIME on 1st round dec 1 st on each side of both markers for toe - SEE DECREASE TIP! Repeat dec every other round 2-3-3 (2-2-2) more times and then every round a total of 2-2-2 (4-4-4) times = 14 sts remain on needle. On next round K all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining 7 sts, tighten tog and fasten.
