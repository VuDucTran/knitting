DECREASE TIP:
To work out how to decrease evenly, count the number of stitches to be decreased over (e.g. 25 stitches) and divide by the number of decreases to be made (e.g. 5) = 5. In this example, knit every 4th and 5th stitch together.

PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 and A.2. Choose diagram for your size.

RAGLAN:
Decrease to raglan in each transition between body and sleeves. All decreases are worked from the right side!
Decrease as follows before the marker: Start 2 stitches before the marker and knit 2 together (= 1 stitch decreased).
Decrease as follows after the marker: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch (= 1 stitch decreased).

INCREASE TIP (for mid under sleeve):
Start 1 stitch after the marker thread, make 1 yarn over, work until there is 1 stitch left on the round, make 1 yarn over and knit 1 (= 2 stitches increased). On the next round knit the yarn overs twisted to prevent holes.
----------------------------------------------------------

JUMPER:
The body is worked in the round with circular needle as far as the armholes. The sleeves are worked in the round with double pointed needles, then the body and sleeves are put together and worked to finished length.

BODY:
Cast on 136-144-152-160-168-176 stitches with circular needle size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 4 cm. Change to circular needle size 5.5 mm. Insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round (= in the side). The next round is worked as follows: Knit the first 25-27-29-29-31-33 stitches and at the same time decrease 5 stitches evenly over these stitches - read DECREASE TIP, work A.1 (choose diagram for your size = 19-19-19-23-23-23 stitches which are increased to 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches on the first round), knit 25-27-29-29-31-33 stitches and at the same time decrease 5 stitches evenly over these stitches, insert 1 marker thread (= in the side), knit the next 67-71-75-79-83-87 stitches and at the same time decrease 11-11-11-13-13-13 stitches evenly over these stitches. There are now 60-64-68-72-76-80 stitches between the marker threads on the front piece and 56-60-64-66-70-74 stitches on the back piece = a total of 116-124-132-138-146-154 stitches on the needle. The next round is worked as follows: 20-22-24-24-26-28 stitches stocking stitch, continue A.1 (= 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches) and work stocking stitch to end of round. Continue the pattern in this way. When A.1 has been completed, work A.2 over these 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches. Repeat A.2 upwards. When the piece measures 20-23-26-29-32-35 cm cast off 4-4-4-6-6-6 stitches in each side for the armholes (cast off 2-2-2-3-3-3 stitches on each side of both marker threads). There are now 56-60-64-66-70-74 stitches on the front piece and 52-56-60-60-64-68 stitches on the back piece. Lay the piece to one side and work the sleeves.

SLEEVE:
Cast on 30-32-32-34-34-36 stitches with double pointed needles size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 4 cm. Change to double pointed needles size 5.5 mm. Insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round (= mid under the sleeve). Knit 1 round where you decrease 4 stitches evenly on round in all sizes – read DECREASE TIP = 26-28-28-30-30-32 stitches. Continue working stocking stitch in the round. When the piece measures 6 cm increase 2 stitches mid under the sleeve – read INCREASE TIP. Increase in this way every 2½-3½-3½-4-5-5½ cm a total of 6-6-7-7-7-7 times = 38-40-42-44-44-46 stitches. When the piece measures 22-26-30-34-38-42 cm cast off 4-4-4-6-6-6 stitches mid under sleeve (cast off 2-2-2-3-3-3 stitches on each side of the marker thread) = 34-36-38-38-38-40 stitches. Lay the piece to one side and work another sleeve in the same way.

YOKE:
Place the sleeves on the same circular needle as the body, where you have cast off stitches for the armhole = 176-188-200-202-210-222 stitches. Insert 1 marker in each transition between body and sleeve (= 4 markers). Continue as before with stocking stitch and A.2 mid front. AT THE SAME TIME on the first round, decrease to RAGLAN – see description above. Decrease to raglan every 2nd round a total of 13-14-15-16-17-18 times.
AT THE SAME TIME when there are 2 decreases to raglan left (if your knitting tension is right in height, the piece now measures approx. 31-35-39-43-47-51 cm mid front), knit together the 10-10-10-12-12-12 stitches over the cable mid front, 2 and 2 (= 5-5-5-6-6-6 stitches decreased). On the next round place the middle 21-23-25-24-26-28 stitches on 1 thread for the neck. Continue working the piece back and forth on the needle from the neck and cast off 1 stitch at the beginning of the next 2 rows for the neck. After all the decreases to raglan and neck, there are 44-46-48-42-40-42 stitches left on the needle.

NECKLINE: 
Knit up from the right side approx. 67-71-75-68-68-72 stitches around the neck (including the stitches on the thread in front) with short circular needle size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round where you decrease evenly to 58-60-62-64-66-68 stitches. Continue by working rib in the round (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 3 cm. Loosely cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl.
The jumper measures approx. 36-40-44-48-52-56 cm from the shoulder down.

ASSEMBLY:
Sew the openings under the sleeves.
