See diagrams A.1 and A.2. The diagrams show all rows in the pattern seen from the right side.

HEEL DECREASE (worked in stocking stitch):
ROW 1 (= right side): Work until (7-7-8-8) stitches remain, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over, turn the piece.
ROW 2 (= wrong side): Work until (7-7-8-8) stitches remain, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over, turn the piece.
ROW 3 (= right side): Work until (6-6-7-7) stitches remain, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over, turn the piece. 
ROW 4 (= wrong side): Work until (6-6-7-7) stitches remain, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over, turn the piece. 
Continue to decrease like this with 1 stitch less before each decrease until there are (10-10-12-12) stitches left on the needle.

DECREASE TIP:
Decrease as follows before the marker thread: Knit 2 together. 
Decrease as follows after the marker thread: Knit 2 stitches twisted together.

SOCK:
The piece is worked in the round with double pointed needles from the top of the sock down to the toe. 
Cast on 64-64-72-72 stitches evenly divided between the double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with denim blue. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (knit 2/ purl 2) for 3-3-3-3 cm. Knit 1 round where you decrease 12-12-12-12 stitches evenly on the round = 52-52-60-60 stitches. Now work pattern as follows: Work A.1 (= 8 stitches) 6-6-7-7 times in width, work A.2 (= 4 stitches). NOTE: on rounds 6,10 and 33, 1 stitch is decreased in diagram A.2 = 49-49-57-57 stitches. On round 40 (= the round with the star) decrease 1 stitch evenly along the round = 48-48-56-56 stitches. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! Continue by working A.1 (= 6-6-7-7 times on the round). On the last round of A.1 adjust the number of stitches to 44-44-56-58 stitches. 

The sock is now finished with pistachio. Keep the first 11-11-13-13 stitches on the needle, place the next 22-22-30-32 stitches on 1 thread (= mid top of foot) and keep the last 11-11-13-13 stitches on the needle = 22-22-26-26 stitches for the heel. Work stocking stitch back and forth over the heel stitches for 4½-4½-5-5 cm.
Insert a marker thread in the middle of the heel stitches (= 11-11-13-13 stitches on each side of the marker thread). The marker thread follows the piece until you start decreasing for the toe. This makes it easier to get the decreases for the toe in the right place. Continue by decreasing for the heel – SEE HEEL DECREASE! After you have decreased for the heel, knit up 11-12-13-13 stitches on each side of the heel and the 22-22-30-32 stitches from the thread are placed back on the needle = 54-56-68-70 stitches. Insert 1 marker thread on each side of the 22-22-30-32 stitches mid top of foot. Continue working stocking stitch, AT THE SAME TIME as you decrease in each side as follows: Knit the last 2 stitches before the 22-22-30-32 stitches mid top of foot twisted together (i.e. you work in the back of the stitch instead of the front), the first 2 stitches after the 22-22-30-32 stitches are knitted together. Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 6-6-10-10 times = 42-44-48-50 stitches. Continue working until the piece measures 11-13-14-16 cm from the marker thread on the heel – there is 4-4-4-4 cm left until finished length. Insert 1 marker thread in the middle of each side so that there are 21-22-24-25 stitches between the marker threads (the marker thread in the heel is mid under the foot). Continue by decreasing for the toe on each side of both marker threads – READ DECREASE TIP! Repeat the decreases in each side every 2nd round a total of 6-6-5-5 times and then every round 2-2-4-4 times = 10-12-12-14 stitches left on the needle. On the next round, knit 2 and 2 stitches together. Cut the strand and pull it through the remaining stitches, pull tight and fasten the strand well.
