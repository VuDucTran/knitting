SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. Cast on 36-40-44-48-52-56 sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with dark blue. K 1 round, then work rib = K 2/P 2 for 3 cm. K 1 round while dec 4 sts evenly = 32-36-40-44-48-52 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and work pattern in the round according to diagram A.1 (choose diagram for correct size). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When diagram A.1 has been worked, continue in stocking st with dark blue until finished measurements. When piece measures 11-12-13-14-15-16 cm, keep the first 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts on needle for heel and slip the last 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts on 1 stitch holder (= mid on top of foot). Work in stocking st back and forth over heel sts for 4-4½-4½-5-5-5 cm. Insert 1 marker in the piece. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above. After heel dec, pick up 9-10-10-11-11-11 sts on each side of heel and slip the 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 42-48-50-56-58-60 sts. Insert 1 marker on each side of the 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts on top of foot. Continue to work in stocking st in the round - AT THE SAME TIME on 1st round dec in each side as follows: K the last 2 sts before the 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts on top of foot tog and K the first 2 sts after the 16-18-20-22-24-26 sts twisted tog. Dec like this every other round 5-7-7-9-9-9 times in total = 32-34-36-38-40-42 sts. Continue to work until piece measures 9-11-13-14-16-18 cm from marker on heel (approx. 4 cm remain until finished measurements). Insert 1 marker in each side so that there are 16-17-18-19-20-21 sts on both upper foot and under foot. On next round dec 1 st on each side of both markers for toe - SEE DECREASE TIP! Dec like this every other round a total of 6 times and then every round 0-0-1-1-2-2 times = 8-10-8-10-8-10 sts remain on needle. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.
