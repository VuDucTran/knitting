SOCK: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles, top down. Cast on 52-52-56-68 sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm with light yellow. K 1 round, continue in rib = P 2/K 2. When rib measures 4-5-5-6 cm, K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 4-4-8-4 sts evenly = 48-48-48-64 sts. K 1 round. Then work A-1 over all sts (= 3-3-3-4 times on round). When A-1 has been worked 1 time vertically, keep the first 12-12-13-15 sts on needle, slip the next 24-24-22-34 sts on a stitch holder (= mid upper foot) and keep the last 12-12-13-15 sts on needle = 24-24-26-30 sts for heel. Work in stocking st back and forth over heel sts with light yellow for 4½-5-5½-6 cm. Insert a marker. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above! After heel dec, knit up 10-10-12-10 sts with light yellow along each side of heel and slip the 24-24-22-34 sts from stitch holder back on needle = 52-52-56-64 sts.
Insert a marker on each side of the middle 26-26-28-32 sts on mid upper foot. Continue in the round with light yellow. AT THE SAME TIME dec in each side as follows: K tog the first 2 sts after the 26-26-28-32 sts on upper foot and K twisted tog the last 2 sts before the 26-26-28-32 sts on upper foot (i.e. work in back loop of sts instead of front). Repeat dec every other round a total of 4 times = 44-44-48-56 sts. When piece measures approx. 16-18-20-22 cm from marker on heel (= approx. 4-4-4-5 cm remain), insert a marker in the mid of each side so that there are 22-22-24-28 sts both on upper foot and under foot. Continue in the round in stocking st with light yellow over all sts. AT THE SAME TIME dec for toe on each side of both markers as follows: 3 sts before marker: K 2 tog, K 2 (marker is between these 2 sts), K 2 twisted tog (i.e. work in back loop of sts instead of front). Repeat dec every other round a total of 3-3-3-4 times and then every round a total of 6-6-7-7 times = 8-8-8-12 sts remain on needle. Cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten.
