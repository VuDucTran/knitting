SLIPPER:
First work an edge at the top of slipper, then work foot before working a loose leg worked across that is sewn on at the end.

EDGE: 
Cast on 24-27-30-33-36-39-42 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with Eskimo. Work in GARTER ST in the round - see explanation above - until piece measures approx. 3-3-3-4-4-4-4 cm, finish after 1 round P. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION 

FOOT:
Keep the first 8-8-10-10-12-12-12 sts on round on needle and slip the remaining 16-19-20-23-24-27-30 sts on a stitch holder. Now work RIB - see explanation above - back and forth over the 8-8-10-10-12-12-12 sts. AT THE SAME TIME on first row cast on 1 new st in each side (= edge st, work this st in garter st) = 10-10-12-12-14-14-14 sts on row. When middle piece measures 4-4-5-6-6-7-8 cm, cast off 1 edge st in each side = 8-8-10-10-12-12-12 sts remain on row. Then slip the sts from stitch holder back on needle and pick up 6-6-8-9-9-11-12 sts on each side of middle part (inside 1 edge st) = 36-39-46-51-54-61-66 sts on needle. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE. Insert 1 marker mid front of toe (in the middle of the 8-8-10-10-12-12-12 sts on middle piece) and 1 marker mid back on heel – NOTE: In size with uneven no of sts insert marker in the middle st at the back. Continue in the round in garter st. When piece measures 2 cm - adjust so that next round is a round with K, dec each side of both markers - READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec like this every other round until piece measures 4-4½-5-5-5½-5½-6 cm – cast off the remaining sts. Sew seams under foot in outer loops of edge sts to avoid a chunky seam.

Cast on 12-12-12-12-16-16-16 sts on needle size 4 mm with Eskimo. Work 2 ridges in GARTER ST back and forth - see explanation above AT THE SAME TIME on last row inc 4 sts evenly = 16-16-16-16-20-20-20 sts. K 1 row from RS. Work next row as follows from WS: 3 edge sts in garter st, * 2 P, 2 K *, repeat from *-* 2-2-2-2-3-3-3 times in total, 2 P and 3 edge sts in garter st. Continue rib like this until piece measures approx. 18-20-22-24-26-28-30 cm and dec AT THE SAME TIME 4 sts evenly on last row from WS = 12-12-12-12-16-16-16 sts. Work 2 ridges in garter st and cast off with K from RS. Place cast-on edge over cast-off edge and sew on 2 buttons for decoration through the leg.
