Garter sts (back and forth on row): Knit all rows
Rib: *K2, P2*, repeat from *-*.

Earflaps: Cast on 4-4-5 sts with 1 thread of each Alpaca colour and needles size 8 mm. K 1 row from the wrong side and continue in stocking sts and 1 edge st in garter sts each side - at the same time inc 1 st each side from the right side as follows: Make a yo inside the edge st each side –twist and knit the yo on the returning row, to avoid a hole – inc 1 st each side on every other row 4 times = 12-12-13 sts. Continue in stocking sts and 1 edge st each side until the flap measures 6-7-8 cm. Put aside and knit another one.

Hat: Knit in one of the earflaps on needle size 8 mm, cast on 8-10-11 new sts (= the back) and knit in the other earflap on the same row = 32-34-37 sts. Knit the next row from the wrong side as follows: 1 garter st, P 10-10-11 sts, K 10-12-13 sts, P 10-10-11 sts and 1 garter st. Continue in stocking sts with 1 edge st each side in garter sts – at the same time inc. 1 st each side as done for the earflaps, a total of 2 times = 36-38-41 sts. On the next row cast on 12-14-15 sts between the earflaps for the front part = 48-52-56 sts. Now do all measures from this point onwards. The hat is from now on knitted on double pointed needles size 8 mm as follows: On the 1st round P the new 12-14-15 sts at the front (continue to knit the other sts in stocking sts), then continue to knit in stocking sts over all sts. When the piece measures 3-3.5-4 cm knit 5-5-6 rounds of Rib and continue in stocking sts until finished. When the piece measures 12-14-16 cm bind off evenly distributed on every other row (K2 tog.): 6-6-6 sts 3 times and 6-7-8 sts 4 times = 6 sts left, cut the thread and pull it through the remaining sts. Sew tight. The hat measures approx. 21-23-25 cm from the centre front and to the top.

Plait: Cut 3 threads of each colour approx. 80 cm long = 12 threads. Fold them in the middle and pull the loop through the top of the hat. Pull the ends through the loop. Separate the threads into 3 bunches (= 8 threads in each), plait them loosely together and make a knot at the end. The plait is approx. 20 cm long.
