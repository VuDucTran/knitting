Stripes: *6 rounds in off white, 6 rounds in dark brown, 6 rounds in light brown*, repeat from *-*.

Cast on 70-77-84 sts with light brown and needles size 5 mm. Knit 6 rounds of garter sts. Change to needles size 5.5 mm and continue in stocking sts and stripes – see explanation above – until finished measurements. Remember the knitting tension! When the piece measures 11-12-13 cm, insert 7 marking threads in the piece with 10-11-12 sts in between each thread. Continue to bind off at the right side of each marking thread as follows: K2 tog on every 4th row 3 times and then on every other row 5-6-7 times = 14 sts left on round. Knit all sts tog 2 by 2, cut the thread and pull it through remaining sts, pull tight and sew the thread. The hat measures approx. 21-23-25 cm.

Earflap: Crochet loosely 7-8-9 ch (inclusive of 3 ch to turn with) on hook size 4mm and dark brown..
1st row – dark brown: Crochet 1 tr in each ch = 5-6-7 tr (1st tr = 3 ch), cut the thread
2nd row- dark brown:  Turn the piece, crochet 3 ch and crochet 1 tr in between each tr from previous row. Around the 3 ch at the end crochet 5 tr and continue to crochet tr’s in between each tr from the 1st the row without turning the piece. Finish with a tr in the last tr from previous row = 13-15-17 tr around the “bend”, cut the thread.
3rd row- light brown: Turn the piece, 3 ch in the first tr and then 1 tr in between each tr from previous row – but in between each of the 5 tr at the top crochet 2 tr, finish with a tr in the last tr from previous row = 18-20-22 tr. Cut the thread.
4th row – off white: : Turn the piece, 3 ch in the first tr and then 1 tr in between each tr from previous row – but in between each of the 6 tr at the top crochet 2 tr, finish with a tr in the last tr from previous row = 24-26-28 tr. Cut the thread.
5th row – dark brown: : Turn the piece, 3 ch in the first tr and then 1 tr in between each tr from previous row – but in between each of the 6 tr at the top crochet 2 tr, finish with a tr in the last tr from previous row = 30-32-34 tr. 
The earflap measures approx 9 cm in the width at the top, and 7-8-9 cm in the height. Crochet one more flap. 

Assembly: Sew 1 flap to each side of the hat, leaving a gap of approx 14-16-18 cm at the centre front and a gap of 12-14-16 cm at the back -sew the flaps edge by edge with the hat with small neat stitches. 
Tassel: Cut 4 threads of each colour, each 18 cm long. Fold them double and pull the loop (with the help of the crochet hook) through the top round of the hat. Pull the ends through the loop and pull tight.



GLOVES:
Knitting Tension: 16 sts x 20 rows on needles size 5.5 mm and stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm.

Cast on 28-32-36 sts with light brown and needles size 5.5 mm. Knit 4 rounds of garter sts, and continue in stocking sts. When the piece measures 3 cm, change to double pointed needles size 4 mm and knit 4-4-5 cm Rib. Change back to double pointed needles size 5.5 mm and continue in stocking sts – measure the piece from this point from now on. At the same time on the first round bind off 6 sts evenly on round = 22-26-30 sts. Remember the knitting tension! When the piece measures 1-1-2 cm insert 3 marking threads in the piece as follows; 1 marking thread (= the side), K 1 st (= the thumb st), 1 marking thread, K 10-12-14 sts (= palm of hand), 1 marking thread (= the side), K 11-13-15 sts (= top of the hand). On the next round inc for the thumb gusset as follows: Inc 1 st each side of the thumb st by knitting 2 st in 1 st. Repeat this on every 3rd round a total of 2-2-3 times = 7-7-9 sts (= the thumb). When the piece measures 3-4-5 cm put the thumb sts on a thread. Cast on 1 new st behind the thumb = 22-26-30 sts and continue in stocking sts. When the piece measures 8-9-11 cm bind off at both sides of the marking threads – see binding off tips: On every other round 3 times and on every round 1-2-3 times = 6 sts left. Cut the thread pull it through the remaining sts, and sew tight. The glove measures approx. 18-20-23 cm

Thumb: Put the 7-7-9 sts from the thread back on double pointed needles size 5.5 mm and pick up 3 sts behind the thumb = 10-10-12 sts. Continue in stocking sts until the thumb measures 3.5-4.5-5.5 cm, knit all sts tog 2 by 2. Cut the thread, pull it through the remaining sts, and sew it tight.

Tie knots loosely with 3 threads in each “bunch” – begin 8 cm from the top of the threads and leave 8 cm without any knots at the bottom. Sew the band edge by edge to the edge of the gloves – begin at the opposite side of the thumb – and tie the loose ends tog at the side.
