When piece measures 15-16-17-18-19-20 cm keep the first 10-10-12-12-12-14 sts on round, slip the next 33-35-35-35-39-39 sts on a stitch holder (= mid upper foot) and keep the last 13-13-13-13-13-15 sts on round = 23-23-25-25-25-29 sts for heel. Work stocking st back and forth on heel sts for 4.5-5-5-5-5.5 -6 cm. Insert a marker in piece.

Dec like this on every other round a total of 7-9-9-9-10-9 times = 48-50-52-52-58-62 sts. Continue until piece measures 13-14-16-18-19-21 cm from marker on heel (approx 4-4-4-4-5-6 cm remain). Insert a marker each side with 24-25-26-26-29-31 sts between them. Continue in stocking st on all sts, AT THE SAME TIME dec on each side of both markers as follows: before K1 and marker: K2 tog, after marker and K1: K2 tog into back of loop. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 0-3-3-3-6-7 times and then on every round 9-7-7-7-5-5 times = 12-10-12-12-14-14 sts. On next round K2 tog all the way round.
