Knitting Tension: Before felting:  16 sts x 20 rows on needles size 5.5 mm in stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm. After felting: approx 20 sts x 32 rows = 10 x 10 cm

Hat with plaits or spiky tassels:

Earflaps: Cast on 6-7-8 sts with Alaska and needles size 5.5 mm. Knit in stocking sts – at the same time inc 1 st each side as follows: Make a yo inside the 1st st each side – knit into back of yo on the return row to avoid a hole – inc 1 st each side on every other row 9-7-5 times and then on every 4th row 1-3-5 times = 26-27-28 sts. Knit 1 more row and put the piece aside. The earflap measures approx. 11.5- 13-15 cm. Knit another one.

Hat: Knit in one of the earflaps on needle size 5.5 mm, cast on 17-22-25 new sts  (= the back) and knit in the other earflap on the same row = 69-76-81 sts. Knit 4 rows of garter sts over all sts – at the same time inc 1 st each side towards the front on every other row (as done for the earflaps) 2 times = 73-80-85 sts. Cast on 26-28-32 sts in between the earflaps for the front – NB: cast on with double thread but continue to knit with a single thread = 99-108-117 sts. Change to double pointed needles size 5.5 mm and continue to knit the hat round in stocking sts. When the hat measures 19-21-23 cm insert 9 marking threads with 11-12-13 sts in between each thread. On the next round bind off as follows: K 2 sts tog to the right of each marking thread on every 4th row a total of 5 times and then on every other row a total of 4-5-6 times = 18 sts. On the next round knit all sts tog 2 by 2 = 9 sts, cut the thread, pull through the remaining sts and sew tight. The hat measures approx. 32-35-38 cm from the centre front and to the top.

Hat with plaits: Attach 1 plait at the bottom of each earflap. 1 plait = cut 12 threads of Alaska each 80 cm long. Fold the threads double and pull the loop through the centre of the casting on edge at the bottom of the earflap (use a crochet hook if difficult), pull the ends through the loop. Separate the threads into 3 bunches of 8 threads and plait them loosely together. Make a knot at the ends. The plait is approx. 25 cm long.


Hat with spiky tassels: To make it easier to place the tassels evenly, blow up a balloon and put the hat on to it. Sew a loose helping thread around the hat approx 15-17-19 cm from the top. Attach the tassels in Eskimo, 1 tassel: Cut 3 threads each measuring 25 cm, fold the threads and pull the loop through 1 st on the hat with the help of a crochet hook, pull the ends through the loop. Make tassels in different colours, some consisting of 3 threads each in different colours. Distribute the tassels as you wish, here they have been attached with a space of 5 cm in between from front to back and 2.5 cm in between from side to side. The hat on the picture has 50 tassels. Now remove the helping thread.

Felt the hat in the washing machine- after felting sew a heart with orange at the front of the hat with small stitches,
