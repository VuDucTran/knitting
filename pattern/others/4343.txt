FELTING:
Wash slippers in the washing machine at 40 degrees with a detergent free of enzymes and optical bleach (usual spin and no pre-wash). Try the slippers on while still wet to shape them to the right size. Leave to dry. At subsequent washes wash slippers at a wool programme. 

Fold approx 3 to 5 cm at the top of leg towards RS.
