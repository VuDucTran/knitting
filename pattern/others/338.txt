Measurement tips: It is important to keep the knitting tension and make sure the measures are correct, so the squares become quadratic. The diagonal on a square x 2 becomes the length of the final slipper.

Square: See diagram 1 for square no. and assembly

Cast on 10-12-13 (14-15-16) sts with light grey and needles size 4.5 mm and knit 5.5-6.5-7 (7.5-8.5-9) cm garter sts  (= square 1), change to off-white and knit 5.5-6.5-7 (7.5-8.5-9) cm garter sts (= square 2). Continue to knit squares alternating between light grey and off white – remember the knitting tension – until 6 squares ( = 3 light grey and 3 off white) – the piece measures 33-39-42 (45-51-54) cm, bind off. Pick up 10-12-13 (14-15-16) sts on the right side of square 2 with light grey – see diagram 1- knit 5.5-6.5-7 (7.5-8.5-9) cm garter sts, bind off. Pick up sts on the left side of square 6 with off-white – see diagram 1 – and knit the same way.

Assembly: Bend the slipper and sew it neatly together edge by edge according to diagram 1 – begin with seam 1, then seam 2 and so on. Diagram 2 shows how the squares are located to each other when the slipper has been sewn together.
The sole of the slipper becomes approx. 16-18-20 (22-24-26) cm long.

Knit another slipper the same way.
