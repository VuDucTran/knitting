K all rows. 1 ridge = 2 rows K. 

PATTERN: 
See diagram A.1 - NOTE: Choose diagram for correct size. Work entire pattern in stocking st.

KNITTING TIP (applies to bands):
On the rows where there are either stripes or pattern border work the colour in the stripes or the base colour of pattern border also over the 5 band sts in each side but do yarn change between band and body (to avoid fastening the yarn on band).

DECREASE/INCREASE TIP:
To calculate how often dec/inc should be done, use the total no of sts on row (e.g. 84 sts), minus bands (e.g. 10 sts) and divide the remaining sts by no of dec/inc to be done (e.g. 7) = 10.6. I.e. In this example dec by working alternately approx. every 9th and 10th st and 10th and 11th st tog or inc after alternately approx. every 10th and 11th st by making 1 YO (work YO twisted on next row to avoid hole – NOTE: Do not inc/dec over bands).

INCREASE TIP-1:
Inc 1 st on each side of marker as follows: Beg 2 sts before marker and make 1 YO, work 4 sts (marker is in the middle of these sts), make 1 YO (= 2 sts inc). On next row work YOs twisted to avoid holes.

DECREASE TIP-1 (applies to mid under sleeve and on inside of leg):
Dec 1 st on each side of marker as follows: Beg 3 sts before marker and K 2 tog, K 2 (marker is between these 2 sts), slip 1 st as if to K, K 1, psso (= 2 sts dec).

BUTTONHOLES:
Dec for buttonhole on right band (when garment is worn). 1 button hole = beg from WS and K tog second and third st from edge and make 1 YO. On next row K the YO to make a hole.
Dec for first buttonhole after 1½-2 cm on neck edge, then dec the next 5-5-6-6 buttonholes every 7½-8-7½-8 cm.
----------------------------------------------------------

SUIT:
Worked back and forth on circular needle from mid front. To make it easier to adjust the length of sleeves and legs the suit is worked top down.

YOKE:
Cast on 84-88-92-96 sts (incl 5 band sts in each side towards mid front) on a short circular needle size 3 mm with red. P 1 row from WS. Work next row as follows from RS: 5 band sts in GARTER ST - see explanation above - * K 2, P 2 *, repeat from *-* until 7 sts remain on needle, finish with K 2 and 5 bands sts in garter st. Continue rib like this for 3 cm – remember BUTTONHOLES on right band – see explanation above and finish after 1 row from RS (= neck edge). Switch to a short circular needle size 4 mm. P 1 row from WS while dec 7-5-4-1 sts evenly - READ DECREASE/INCREASE TIP = 77-83-88-95 sts on needle. Then work an elevation at the back in stocking st as follows: K until 12-13-14-15 sts remain, turn, tighten yarn and P until 12-13-14-15 sts remain in the other side. Turn, tighten yarn and K until 20-22-24-26 sts remain, turn, tighten yarn and P until 20-22-24-26 sts remain in the other side. Turn, tighten yarn and K until 28-31-34-37 sts remain, turn, tighten yarn and P until 28-31-34-37 sts remain in the other side. Turn, tighten yarn and K the rest of row, then P 1 row from WS (work bands in garter st). Work next row as follows from RS: 5 band sts in garter st, work pattern according to diagram A.1 until 6 sts remain on row - NOTE: Choose diagram for correct size (= 11-12-11-12 repetitions of 6-6-7-7 sts), work first st in A.1 (so that pattern beg and ends the same way inside band in each - NOTE: Do not inc in this st) and finish with 5 band sts in garter st. Continue pattern like this and inc as shown in diagram - READ KNITTING TIP AND REMEMBER KNITTING TENSION. When A.1 has been worked = 187-203-220-239 sts on needle. Work 0-1-0-1 cm with cerise. Piece now measures approx. 13-14-15-16 cm mid front (measured without rib in the neck). Now work piece in stocking st with cerise. On first row from RS inc now 7-7-10-7 sts evenly (do not inc over bands) = 194-210-230-246 sts. Work next row as follows from WS: Work 29-31-34-36 sts as before, slip the next 42-46-50-54 sts on 1 stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts on row, work 52-56-62-66 sts (= back piece), slip the next 42-46-50-54 sts on 1 stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts on row and work 29-31-34-36 sts as before. 

BODY:
= 122-130-142-150 sts. Insert 1 marker 32-34-37-39 sts in from each side (= 58-62-68-72 sts between markers on back piece). NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE! Then continue back and forth in stocking st and 5 band sts in garter st in each side towards mid front  - remember BUTTONHOLES on band. When piece measures 10-10-12-12 cm, inc on each side of both markers – READ INCREASE TIP 1 (= 4 sts inc). Repeat inc when piece measures 20-20-24-24 cm = 130-138-150-158 sts. When piece measures 29-31-35-38 cm from armhole, end bands mid front. Cast off the first 3 sts at the beg of the next 2 rows = 124-132-144-152 sts. Then work in stocking st in the round over all sts for approx. 3 cm – piece now measures 32-34-38-41 cm from armhole and 45-48-53-57 cm from mid front (measured without rib in neck). Now divide for legs. 

LEG:
Beg mid front, switch to double pointed needles size 4 mm and work in stocking st in the round over the first 62-66-72-76 sts (keep the remaining 62-66-72-76 sts on circular needle). Insert 1 marker at beg of round = inside of leg. When leg measures 2 cm from dividing for legs, dec 2 sts on inside of leg - READ DECREASE TIP-1 (= 2 sts dec). Repeat dec every 3rd-4th-6th-7th round a total of 10-10-11-11 times = 42-46-50-54 sts. When leg measures 13-18-25-31 cm, K 1 round while inc 10 sts evenly = 52-56-60-64 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work rib in the round = K 2/P 2 for 8-8-10-10 cm (or desired length). On next round, inc all 2 P sts to 3 P sts = 65-70-75-80 sts. Then cast off sts with K over K and P over P.
Slip sts from circular needle on double pointed needles size 4 mm and work the other leg the same way. Entire suit now measures approx. 66-74-88-98 cm mid front (measured without rib in the neck).

SLEEVE:
Slip sts from one stitch holder back on double pointed needles size 4 mm, pick up 1 st in each of the 6 sts cast on under sleeve = 48-52-56-60 sts. Insert 1 marker in the middle of the 6 sts (= mid under sleeve). NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE! Work in stocking st in the round with cerise. When sleeve measures 2-2-1-1 cm, dec 2 sts mid under sleeve - READ DECREASE TIP-1. Repeat dec every 3rd-3rd-4th-4th round a total of 7-9-10-12 times = 34-34-36-36 sts. When sleeve measures 10-12-15-18 cm, K 1 round while inc 6-6-8-8 sts evenly = 40-40-44-44 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work rib in the round = K 2/P 2 for 8-8-10-10 cm (or desired length). On next round, inc all 2 P sts to 3 P sts = 50-50-55-55 sts. Then cast off sts with K over K and P over P. 
Work the other sleeve the same way.
