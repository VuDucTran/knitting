RIGHT SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 40-44-52-56 sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm with Merino Extra Fine. K 1 round and continue in rib K2/P2 until piece measures 10-12-14-16 cm. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! Now keep the first 18-22-26-26 sts on needle for heel and slip remaining 22-22-26-30 sts on a stitch holder = upper foot.
Work stocking st back and forth on heel sts for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker, and now measure piece from here. Dec for heel - see HEEL DEC. After heel dec pick up 10-11-13-15 sts each side of heel and slip the 22-22-26-30 sts from upper foot back on needle = 50-54-62-70 sts. Insert a marker each side of the 22-22-26-30 sts on upper foot.  Continue in rib (with P2 each side) on upper foot and stocking st on sts under foot, AT THE SAME TIME dec each side as follows: K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 22-22-26-30  sts on upper foot and K tog the first 2 sts after the 22-22-26-30 sts on upper foot. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 6 times for all sizes = 38-42-50-58 sts. When piece measures 16-18-19-22 cm from marker on heel (3-4-5-5 cm remain) slip the 20-22-26-30 sts from upper foot on a stitch holder and the 18-20-24-28 sts under foot on another stitch holder.

DEC FOR TOES:
Slip 13-15-19-22 sts (on right side of piece as seen from the leg of sock towards the toes) from stitch holder on upper foot and 13-13-17-20 sts from stitch holder under foot (on the same side) back on needle = 26-28-36-42  sts. Cast on 4 new sts towards sts on stitch holders = 30-32-40-46 sts. Insert a marker each side with 15-16-20-23 sts on upper foot and 15-16-20-23 sts under foot. Continue in stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME on 4th round dec for toes each side of both markers (= 4 dec) as follows: Dec as follows before marker: K2 tog. Dec as follows after marker: K2 tog into back of loop. Dec 1 st each side of marker towards big toe on every other round 3-4-5-6 times and dec 1 st each side of marker towards the side on every round 6-8-10-12 times = 12-8-10-10 sts left on needle. K 1 round and cast off remaining sts. Sew tog at top in outer loops of sts. 

BIG TOE:
Slip the remaining 7-7-7-8 sts from stitch holder on upper foot and the remaining 5-7-7-8 sts from stitch holder under foot back on needle. Pick up 2 sts towards the dec for toes = 14-16-16-18 sts. Work stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME after approx 1 cm inc 2 sts evenly = 16-18-18-20 sts. Continue in stocking st until big toe measures approx 3-4-5-5 cm. Now K2 tog all the way round = 8-9-9-10 sts. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
