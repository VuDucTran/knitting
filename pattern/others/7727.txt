Worked in the round on double pointed needles. Cast on 32-36-40-44-48-52-56 sts on double pointed needle size 3.5 mm with Alaska. K 1 round. Then work rib with K 2/P 2 until piece measures approx. 8-9-10-11-12-13-14 cm. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION

FOOT:
In size 20/21 + 22/23 + 24/25 keep the first 14 sts on round on needle. In size 26/28 + 29/31 move beg of round 1 st back so that first st on round is a P st, keep the first 16 sts on round.
In size 32/34 + 35/37 keep the first 18 sts on round on needle.
Slip the remaining 18-22-26-28-32-34-38 sts on 1 stitch holder. Continue with RIB - see explanation above - back and forth over the 14-14-14-16-16-18-18 sts. AT THE SAME TIME on 1st row cast on 1 new st in each side (= edge sts, work these sts K on every row) = 16-16-16-18-18-20-20 sts. When middle piece measures 4-4-5-6-6-7-8 cm, cast off 1 edge st in each side = 14-14-14-16-16-18-18 sts remain on row. Then slip the sts from stitch holder back on needle and pick up 8-8-10-12-12-14-16 sts on each side of middle part (inside 1 edge st) = 48-52-60-68-72-80-88 sts. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE! Insert 1 marker in the middle of the 2 sts mid front of toe and 1 marker between the middle 2 sts back on heel and work in the round in GARTER ST - see explanation above. When piece measures 2 cm - adjust so that next round is a round with K, dec each side of both markers - READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Dec like this every other round (i.e. on every K round) until piece measures 4-4½-5-5-5½-5½-6 cm – cast off the remaining sts. 
Sew seams under foot in outer loops of edge sts to avoid a chunky seam.
