PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 to A.3. Choose diagram for your size. The whole pattern is worked in stocking stitch.

DECREASE TIP-1:
To work out how to decrease evenly, count the total number of stitches on the needle (e.g. 52 stitches) and divide by the number of decreases to be made (e.g. 4) = 13. 
In this example, knit every 12th and 13th stitch together.

DECREASE TIP-2:
Decrease as follows before the marker: Start 2 stitches before the marker and knit 2 together. 
Decrease as follows after the marker: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch.

KNITTING TIP (for heel):
To strengthen the heel you can use 2 strands when working heel and heel decreases as follows: Use the strand from the inside and outside of the ball and work 1 stitch alternately with the one then the other strand. In this way, you get a slightly thicker heel without using a double strand.

HEEL DECREASE:
ROW 1(= RIGHT SIDE): Work until there are 5-6-7-8-8 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch, turn the piece.
ROW 2 (= wrong side): Work until there are 5-6-7-8-8 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over the purled stitch, turn the piece.
ROW 3 (= right side): Work until there are 4-5-6-7-7 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch, turn the piece. 
ROW 4 (= wrong side): Work until there are 4-5-6-7-7 stitches left, slip the next stitch as if to purl, purl 1, pass the slipped stitch over the purled stitch, turn the piece. 
Continue to decrease in the same way, by working until there is 1 less stitch before slipping 1 stitch and until there are 10-10-10-10-10 stitches left on the needle.
--------------------------------------------------------

SOCK:
The piece is worked in the round with double pointed needles, top down.
Cast on 44-44-48-52-52 stitches with double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and north sea. Knit 1 round, then work rib in the round (= knit 2 / purl 2). When the rib measures 3 cm knit 1 round where you decrease 2-2-0-4-4 stitches evenly on round – read DECREASE TIP-1 = 42-42-48-48-48 stitches. Continue by working A.1 in the round (= 7-7-8-8-8 repeats of 6 stitches). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! On the round marked with arrow-1 in A.1 decrease 2-2-0-0-0 stitches evenly on round = 40-40-48-48-48 stitches. When A.1 has been completed, work the next round as follows:
SIZES 24/25 and 26/28: Work A.2B in the round (= 4 repeats of 10 stitches).
SIZES 29/31, 32/34 and 35/37: Work A.2A (= 4 stitches), work A.2B over the next 40 stitches (= 4 repeats of 10 stitches) and finish with A.2C (= 4 stitches).
Continue the pattern in this way. When A.2 has been completed, work A.3 in the round (= 5-5-6-6-6 repeats of 8 stitches). On the round marked with arrow-2 in A.3 decrease 4-0-4-0-0 stitches evenly on round = 36-40-44-48-48 stitches. When A.3 has been completed continue with stocking stitch and forest green. 
When the piece measures 14-15-16-17-18 cm keep the first 9-10-11-12-12 stitches on the needle for heel, place the next 18-20-22-24-24 stitches on 1 thread (= mid top of foot) and keep the last 9-10-11-12-12 stitches on the needle for heel. Read  KNITTING TIP and work stocking stitch back and forth with forest green over the 18-20-22-24-24 heel stitches for 4½-4½-5½-5½-5½ cm. Insert 1 marker in the middle of the row – THE PIECE IS NOW MEASURED FROM HERE! 
Continue by working HEEL DECREASE – see description above! After heel decrease, knit up 10-10-12-12-12 stitches on each side of the heel and the 18-20-22-24-24 stitches from the thread are replaced on the needles = 48-50-56-58-58 stitches on the needles. Continue in the round with stocking stitch and forest green.
AT THE SAME TIME decrease in each side as follows: Knit together the first 2 stitches after the 18-20-22-24-24 stitches on top of the foot and knit twisted together the last 2 stitches before the 18-20-22-24-24 stitches on top of the foot. Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 6-6-8-8-8 times = 36-38-40-42-42 stitches. Continue working until the piece measures 11-13-14-16-18 cm from the marker on the heel. Insert 1 new marker in each side so that there are 18-19-20-21-21 stitches both on top of and underneath the foot. Continue in the round with stocking stitch - AT THE SAME TIME decrease 1 stitch on each side of both markers for toe - read DECREASE TIP-2. Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 6-6-5-5-5 times and then every round a total of 0-0-2-2-2 times = 12-14-12-14-14 stitches left on the needles. On the next round knit all stitches together 2 and 2 = 6-7-6-7-7 stitches left. Cut the strand, pull it through the remaining stitches, pull tight and fasten well. Work another sock in the same way.
