Start mid back, work 54-58-62 (66-70-74) stitches stocking stitch, cast off 2 stitches, work 8 stitches stocking stitch (= mid front), cast off 2 stitches and work 54-58-62 (66-70-74) stitches stocking stitch. On the next round, cast on 2 new stitches over each of the two holes where the stitches were cast off.

PATTERN: 
See diagram A.1. The diagram shows all rows in the pattern from the right side.

ELEVATION BACK: 
Continue A.1 back and forth as follows: Start mid back and work 5-5-5 (7-7-7) stitches pattern, turn the piece, tighten the strand and work back 10-10-10 (14-14-14) stitches pattern. Turn the piece, tighten the strand and work 18-18-18 (24-24-24) stitches, turn the piece, tighten the strand and work back 26-26-26 (34-34-34) stitches. Continue in this way by working over 8-8-8 (10-10-10) more stitches each time the piece is turned 4 more times (= a total of 8 short rows). Then turn the piece and work from the right side back to mid back. 

INCREASE TIP:
Start 1 stitch before the marker thread, make 1 yarn over, continue  A.1 over the next 2 stitches as before (= mid front or mid back), make 1 yarn over (= 2 stitches increased). On the next round work the yarn overs twisted to prevent holes - the increased stitches are worked in to A.1as you go.

DECREASE TIP (for the inside leg):
DECREASE AS FOLLOWS AFTER THE MARKER THREAD:
When the first stitch is knit: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch.
When the first stitch is purl: Purl 2 stitches twisted together.
DECREASE AS FOLLOWS BEFORE THE MARKER THREAD:
When the last stitch is knit: Knit 2 together.
When the last stitch is purl: Purl 2 together.
----------------------------------------------------------

SHORTS:
The piece is worked in the round  with circular needle from the waist and down. The legs are worked in the round with double pointed needles.
Cast on 120-128-136 (144-152-160) stitches with circular needle size 2.5 mm and BabyAlpaca Silk. The round’s beginning = mid back. Work stocking stitch for 3 cm. Work 1 round purl for the fold edge – THE PIECE IS NOW MEASURED FROM HERE. Work stocking stitch for 1½ cm. On the next 2 rounds, work HOLES FOR THE TIES – see description above. Then continue with stocking stitch until the piece measures 3 cm from the fold edge. Change to circular needle size 3 mm and work A.1 in the round. When you have worked 2 rounds of A.1 work ELEVATION BACK – see description above. When the elevation has been completed continue with A.1 in the round over all the stitches again. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!
When the piece measures 10-12-14 (15-16-18) cm from the fold edge in the waist (measured mid front) insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round and 1 marker thread after 60-64-68 (72-76-80) stitches (= mid front and mid back of the shorts). On the next round, increase 1 stitch on each side of both marker threads – READ INCREASE TIP (= 4 stitches increased – NOTE: The increased stitches are worked into A.1 as you go). Increase in this way every 4th round for a total of 4 times = 136-144-152 (160-168-176) stitches. After the last increase, the piece measures approx. 14-16-18 (19-20-22) cm from the waist (measured from the fold edge mid front).

LEGS: 
Start mid back and work A.1 over the first 68-72-76 (80-84-88) stitches as before. Place the remaining 68-72-76 (80-84-88) stitches on a thread. Change to double pointed needles size 3 mm and continue A.1 in the round. Insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round = the inner leg. When you have worked 1-1-2 (2-2-2) cm decrease 1 stitch on each side of the marker thread – READ DECREASE TIP (= 2 stitches decreased). Decrease in this way every 2nd -2nd -2nd (3rd-4th-4th) round a total of 4 times in all sizes = 60-64-68 (72-76-80) stitches. Change to double pointed needles size 2.5 mm when the leg measures 3-4-5 (6-7-7) cm (the decreases should now have been completed). Work 4 rounds stocking stitch, purl 1 round for the fold edge and 4 rounds stocking stitch. Change back to double pointed needles size 3 mm and loosely cast off. The leg measures approx. 4-5-6 (7-8-8) cm from the separation and down to the fold edge. Work the other leg in the same way. The complete length of the shorts is approx. 18-21-24 (26-28-30) cm from the waist and down (measured from the fold edge mid front to the fold edge down on the legs). 

ASSEMBLY:
Fold down the edge at the top of the shorts towards the wrong side and sew down, but make sure that the seam does not tighten.
Do the same at the bottom of both legs.

I-CORD TIE:
Cast on 4 stitches with double pointed needles size 2.5 mm and BabyAlpaca Silk. Work as follows: Knit 4, push the stitches to the beginning of the needle, tighten the strand at the back of the piece and knit 4 stitches. Continue in this way (the piece is not turned) until the tie measures approx. 100-120 cm. Cut the strand, pull it through the 4 stitches, tighten the strand and fasten well. Start mid front and thread the tie through the casting in the waist of the shorts. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
