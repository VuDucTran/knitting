RIGHT SOCK:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 40-44-48-52 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with 1 thread of each colour. K 1 round and continue in rib as follows: K1, * P2/K2 *, repeat from *-* and finish with P2 and K1. Continue like this until piece measures 4-4-5-5 cm. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! Now continue in rib on the first 22-22-26-26 sts and stocking st on remaining sts. Continue like this until piece measures 11-13-15-17 cm. Now keep the first 22-22-26-26 sts on needle for heel and slip remaining 18-22-22-26 sts on a stitch holder = upper foot. 
Work rib back and forth on heel sts for 4.5-5-5.5-6 cm. Insert a marker, and now measure piece from here. Dec for heel - see HEEL DEC. After heel dec pick up 9-10-11-12 sts each side of heel and slip the 18-22-22-26 sts from upper foot back on needle = 46-52-56-62 sts. Insert a marker each side of the 18-22-22-26 sts on upper foot.  Continue in stocking st on all sts, AT THE SAME TIME dec each side as follows: K tog into back of loop the last 2 sts before the 18-22-22-26  sts on upper foot and K tog the first 2 sts after the 18-22-22-26 sts on upper foot. Repeat the dec on every other round a total of 8 times for all sizes = 30-36-40-46 sts. When piece measures 16-18-19-22 cm from marker on heel (3-4-5-5 cm remain) slip the 16-18-20-24 sts from upper foot on a stitch holder and the 14-18-20-22 sts under foot on another stitch holder.

DEC FOR TOES:
Slip 11-12-14-17 sts (on right side of piece as seen from the leg of sock towards the toes) from stitch holder on upper foot and 9-12-14-15 sts from stitch holder under foot (on the same side) back on needle = 20-24-28-32  sts. Cast on 4 new sts towards sts on stitch holders = 24-28-32-36 sts. Insert a marker each side with 12-14-16-18 sts on upper foot and 12-14-16-18 sts under foot. Continue in stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes each side of both markers (= 4 dec) as follows: 
Dec as follows before marker: K2 tog. Dec as follows after marker: K2 tog into back of loop. Dec 1 st each side of marker towards big toe on every other round 2-3-4-4 times and dec 1 st each side of marker towards the side on every round 4-6-8-8 times = 12-10-8-12 sts left on needle. K 1 round and cast off remaining sts. Sew tog at the top in outer loops of sts. 

BIG TOE:
Slip the remaining 5-6-6-7 sts from stitch holder on upper foot and the remaining 5-6-6-7 sts from stitch holder under foot back on needle = 10-12-12-14 sts. Pick up 4 sts towards the dec for toes = 14-16-16-18 sts. Work stocking st in the round, AT THE SAME TIME after approx 1 cm inc 2 sts evenly = 16-18-18-20 sts. Continue in stocking st until big toe measures approx 3-4-5-5 cm. Now K2 tog all the way round = 8-9-9-10 sts. Cut the thread, pull it through remaining sts, tighten and fasten.
