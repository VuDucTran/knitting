DECREASE TIP (for hat):
Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch (= 1 stitch decreased).
----------------------------------------------------------

HAT:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, change to double pointed needles when necessary. Cast on 72-76-80-84 stitches with circular needle size 4 mm and Air. Work 4 rounds stocking stitch (rolling edge). Insert 1 marker. Then work 4 rounds rib (= knit 1 / purl 1). Change to circular needle size 5 mm after the rib and work stocking stitch. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 16-17-18-19 cm from the marker, decrease 0-4-0-0 stitches evenly on round = 72-72-80-84 stitches. 
Now insert 6-6-8-7 new markers in the piece with 12-12-10-12 stitches between each. On the next round decrease 1 stitch after each marker – read DECREASE TIP (= 6-6-8-7 stitches decreased). Decrease in this way every 2nd round a total of 3 times in all sizes, then every round a total of 3 times in all sizes = 36-36-32-42 stitches left on the needles. * Knit 1 round, on the next round knit all stitches together 2 and 2 * = 18-18-16-21 stitches. Work from *-* one more time = 9-9-8-11 stitches left on the needles. Cut the strand, pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten and fasten well. The hat measures approx. 21-22-23-24 cm from the top down to the marker by the rolling edge.
----------------------------------------------------------

NECK WARMER:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, top down. Cast on 68-72-76-84 stitches with circular needle size 4 mm and Air. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 3 cm. Change to circular needle size 5 mm and work stocking stitch. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! Change to circular needle size 4 mm when the piece measures 9-11-13-15 cm. Work rib in the round (= knit 1 / purl 1). When the rib measures 1 cm work the next round as follows: * Knit 1, purl 1, make 1 yarn over, knit 1, purl 1 *, work from *-* to end of round = 85-90-95-105 stitches. The next round is worked as follows: * Knit 1, purl 2 (the yarn over is purled twisted to prevent holes), knit 1, purl 1 *, work from *-* to end of round. Continue with knit over knit and purl over purl until the rib measures 3 cm. Change to circular needle size 5 mm and cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl. The neck warmer measures approx. 12-14-16-18 cm from the cast-on edge and down.
