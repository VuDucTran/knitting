Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comINFORMATION FOR PATTERN:

GARTER STITCH (worked in the round):
1 ridge = 2 rounds. Knit 1 round and purl 1 round. 


EDGE (for hat with striped edge):
Work * 1 ridge in GARTER STITCH - see explanation above, with white, 1 ridge with red *, work from *-* 4 times in total, work 1 ridge with white = 9 ridges.

EDGE (for hat with white edge):
Work 9 ridges in GARTER ST - see explanation above, with white.

DECREASE TIP (evenly):
To calculate how to decrease evenly, use the total number of stitches on row (e.g. 76 stitches) and divide stitches by number of decreases to be done (e.g. 4) = 19. 
In this example, decrease by knitting every 18th and 19th stitch together. 
----------------------------------------------------------

HAT WITH STRIPED EDGE:
Worked in the round on circular needle, switch to double pointed needles when needed.
Cast on 76-78-84 stitches on circular needle size 4.5 mm with white. Work in EDGE - see explanation above. Edge measures 5 cm. Switch to circular needle size 5 mm and continue with red and stocking stitch. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!
When piece measures 13-13-15 cm, work 1 round while at the same time decreasing 4-0-0 stitches evenly - read DECREASE TIP = 72-78-84 stitches.
Insert 6 marker threads in the hat without working, 12-13-14 stitches apart. Then decrease after every marker thread by knitting 2 together (= 6 stitches decreased on round). Decrease like this every 3½-3½-3 cm 10-12-11 times in total = 12 stitches remain on needles. Then knit all stitches together 2 by 2 = 6 stitches. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten together and fasten. Piece measures approx. 45-48-48 cm.

POMPOM:
Make a pompom of approx. 5 cm in diameter with white. Fasten the pompom at the top of the hat.
