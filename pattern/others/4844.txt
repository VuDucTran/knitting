SOCK:
Cast on 44-48-48 (52-56) sts on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with Fabel. Work 7-8-9 (10-11) cm rib, K2/P2. Now keep the first 18-22-22 (22-26) sts on needle for heel and slip remaining 26-26-26 (30-30) sts on a stitch holder = upper foot. Continue back and forth on heel sts in stocking st for 3-3.5-4 (4-4.5) cm. Insert a marker in piece. Now dec for heel – SEE ABOVE. After heel dec pick up 8-9-10 (11-12) sts on each side of heel and slip sts from stitch holder back on needles = 50-54-56 (62-66) sts on round. Continue in rib on the 26-26-26 (30-30) sts on upper foot and stocking st on remaining sts. AT THE SAME TIME dec 1 st on each side of rib – SEE DECREASING TIP-1 – on every other round a total of 5-7-6 (7-9) times = 40-40-44 (48-48) sts. Work K over K and P over P until sock measures 7-8-9 (10-12) cm from marker on heel (3-3-3 (4-4) cm remain to finished measurements). Insert a marker each side with 20-20-22 (24-24) sts on upper foot and 20-20-22 (24-24) sts under foot.
