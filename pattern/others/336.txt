Earflaps: Cast on 7-7-7 sts with light brown and needles size 5 mm. Knit in garter sts – at the same time start to inc after the 1st row as follows: Make a yo inside the 1st st each side, knit into the back of the yo on the returning row, to avoid a hole . Inc 1 st each side on every 4th row a total of 4-5-6 times = 15-17-19 sts. Continue in garter sts until the flap measures 6-7-8 cm. Put aside and knit another one.

Hat: Please read all of this section before continuing.
Put one of the earflaps on needle size 5 mm, cast on 9-12-14 new sts for the back and knit in the other earflap on the same row = 39-46-52 sts. Knit 4 rows back and forth in garter sts over all sts – at the same time inc 1 st each side on every other row (as done for the earflaps) 2 times = 43-50-56 sts. On the next row cast on 21-22-24 sts between the earflaps for the front = 64-72-80 sts. Change to double pointed needles size 5 mm and continue to knit the hat in the round – now do all measurements from this point! Knit 6 rounds of garter sts over all sts, cut the thread and change to double pointed needles size 5.5 mm. Begin at the centre back of the hat – knit M.1, then P 1 round, K 3 rounds and P 1 round before continuing in stocking sts until finished measurements. Remember the knitting tension! At the same time when the piece measures 12 cm insert 8 marking threads with 8-9-10 sts between each thread. Continue to bind off at the right side of all the marking threads as follows: K2 tog on every 3rd round until 8 sts left.  Now knit 2 rounds of stocking sts, cut the thread and pull through the remaining sts, sew tight. The hat measures approx. 23-24-25 cm from the centre front to the top.
