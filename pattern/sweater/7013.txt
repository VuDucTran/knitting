Work 4 ridges in GARTER ST and remember BUTTONHOLES on band - see explanation above.

When rib measures 3-3-3-4-4-4 cm, switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm. Then work in stocking st but continue rib over the middle 28-28-34-34-40-40 sts mid back (= 14-18-18-22-22-26 sts in stocking st at the front of sock). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When piece measures 5-5-5-6-6-6 cm, dec every other P 4 to P 3 (dec 1 st by P 2 tog = 3-3-3-3-4-4 sts dec). After 2½-3-4-5-6-6 cm dec the remaining P 4 to P 3. Repeat dec every 2½-3-4-5-6-6 cm 2 more times = 32-36-40-44-48-52 sts remain on needle and 2 P sts in each P section mid back. Continue to work until piece measures 15-18-21-24-27-29 cm. Now keep the middle 18-18-22-22-26-26 sts mid back on needle for heel and slip the remaining 14-18-18-22-22-26 sts on 1 stitch holder (= mid on top of foot). Continue rib back and forth over heel sts for 4½-5-5-5½-5½-6 cm. Insert 1 marker in middle of needle. Then work HEEL DECREASE - see explanation above. After heel dec pick up 10-11-11-12-12-13 sts on each side of heel and slip sts from stitch holder back on needle = 44-50-52-58-58-64 sts on needle. Continue in the round in stocking st. AT THE SAME TIME dec on each side sts on top of foot as follows: K the last 2 sts before the 14-18-18-22-22-26 sts on top of foot tog and K the first 2 sts after the 14-18-18-22-22-26 sts twisted tog. Dec every other round 7-8-8-9-9-11 times in total = 30-34-36-40-40-42 sts. 
Continue to work until piece measures approx. 10-12-13-14-16-18 cm from marker on heel (approx. 3-3-4-4-4-4 cm remain until finished measurements). Insert 1 marker in each side so that there are 15-17-18-20-20-21 sts on both upper foot and under foot. Then dec for toes on each side of both markers - READ DECREASE TIP. Repeat dec every other round a total of 4-4-5-5-5-5 times and then every round 2-2-2-3-3-3 times = 6-10-8-8-8-10 sts remain on needle. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining sts, tighten tog and fasten. Sock measures approx. 13-15-17-18-20-22 cm from marker on heel. Knit another sock.
