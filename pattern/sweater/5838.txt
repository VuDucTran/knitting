Cast on 155-169-183-204 sts (incl 4 band sts in each side towards mid front) on circular needle size 3 mm with raspberry. K 1 row from WS, continue with diagram A-1 but work 4 band sts in each side in GARTER ST – see explanation above. When piece measures 2 cm, beg to cast off for BUTTON HOLES – see explanation above. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! 
When piece measures 17-20-23-26 cm, work next row from RS as follows: 37-41-44-49 sts as before (= right front piece), cast off 6 sts for armhole, work 69-75-83-94 sts as before (= back piece), cast off 6 sts for armhole and work as before over the remaining 37-41-44-49 sts (= left front piece). Finish each part separately.

= 37-41-44-49 sts. Continue A-1 - AT THE SAME TIME cast off for armhole at beg of every row from the side: 2 sts 1-1-2-3 times and 1 st 2-3-3-3 times = 33-36-37-40 sts. Continue to work until piece measures 23-27-30-34 cm, slip the outermost 12-14-14-15 sts towards mid front on a stitch holder for neck.

COLOURS ON CROCHET SQUARES:
Squares are worked in 2 different colour combinations:
SQUARE A: Cast on + 1st round = raspberry, 2nd round = lime, 3rd and 4th round = medium pink, 5th round = lime.
SQUARE B: Cast on + 1st round = lime, 2nd round = medium pink, 3rd and 4th round = raspberry, 5th round = lime.

CROCHET TIP: Replace first tr at beg of every round with 3 ch and finish every round with 1 sl st in third ch from beg of round. 

BOBBLE: 3 tr that are worked tog, i.e. wait with last pull through on every tr until all 3 tr have been worked, make a YO on hook and pull through all 4 loops. 

WORK THE SQUARES AS FOLLOWS: 
Work 4 ch on hook size 3 mm and form a ring with 1 sl st in first ch. 
ROUND 1: Work 12 tr in ch-ring – read CROCHET TIP.
ROUND 2: 2 tr in every tr = 24 tr. 
ROUND 3: * 1 dc in tr, 3 ch, skip 1 tr *, repeat from *-*, finish with 1 sl st in first dc from beg of round (= 12 dc with ch-loops in between). 
ROUND 4: In first ch-loop work [-]: * [1 BOBBLE – see explanation above, 2 ch, 1 bobble, 4 ch (= corner), 1 bobble, 2 ch, 1 bobble], 3 ch, 1 htr in dc between the next 2 ch-loops, 3 ch, skip 1 ch-loop *, repeat from *-* a total of 4 times but the last time finish after 3 ch with 1 sl st at the top of first bobble. 
ROUND 5: * 2 dc in first 2-ch-loop, 6 dc in next 4-ch-loop (= corner), 2 dc in next 2-ch-loop, 3 dc in next 3-ch-loop, 3 dc in next 3-ch-loop *, repeat from *-* the entire round. Square measures approx. 7 x 7 cm.

Work 5-5-6-6 squares of B and 4-5-5-6 squares of A = 9-10-11-12 squares in total. Sew squares to into a long strip, place the colours alternately – sew edge to edge with lime to avoid a chunky seam. Sew the square strip to bottom of jacket, edge to edge with neat little stitches – the squares should go all the way out to each side, to and with the bands. 

PICOT BORDER: 
Work a picot border with medium pink on hook size 3 mm around the entire jacket, i.e. at the bottom, along the bands and around the neck: * 1 dc, 3 ch, 1 dc in first ch (= 1 picot), skip 1 dc *, repeat from *-*. Work the same way around the bottom of sleeves, finish round with 1 sl st in first dc.
