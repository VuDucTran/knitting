DRESS:
Worked in the round on circular needle from bottom up.
Cast on 217-231-245 (259-280-287) sts on circular needle size 3.5 mm with Cotton Merino. Work 2 ridges in GARTER ST in the round - see explanation above. K 1 round, then continue pattern in the round according to diagram A.1. When A.1 has been worked 1 time vertically, 186-198-210 (222-240-246) sts remain on needle and piece measures approx. 6 cm. K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 2-4-0 (2-4-2) sts evenly = 184-194-210 (220-236-244) sts.
Now insert 6 markers in the piece as follows: Insert 1st marker at beg of round (= side), 2nd marker after 27-29-32 (33-35-37) sts, 3rd marker after another 38-39-41 (44-48-48) sts, 4th marker after another 27-29-32 (33-35-37) sts (= side), 5th marker after another 27-29-32 (33-35-37) sts, 6th marker after another 38-39-41 (44-48-48) sts (27-29-32 (33-35-37) sts remain on round after last marker). Work in stocking st and move the markers upwards when working. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION
When piece measures 8 cm, dec 1 st on each side of 1st and 4th marker, dec 1 st after 2nd and 5th marker and 1 st before 3rd and 6th marker – READ DECREASE TIP (= 8 sts dec). Repeat dec every 1½-1½-2 (2-2-2½) cm 11-11-12 (12-13-13) times in total = 96-106-114 (124-132-140) sts. Remove the 6 markers and insert 1 new marker at beg of round and 1 marker after 48-53-57 (62-66-70) sts (= sides). When piece measures 24-25-30 (33-36-40) cm (dec should now be done), work pattern in the round according to diagram A.2. When A.2 has been worked 1 time vertically, work in stocking st. When piece measures 28-29-34 (37-40-44) cm, work 2 ridges in garter st over the middle 10-10-12 (12-14-14) sts in each side (i.e. over 5-5-6 (6-7-7) sts on each side of both markers – NOTE: Work the other sts in stocking st as before). On next round after the 2 ridges, cast off the middle 6-6-8 (8-10-10) sts in each side for armholes (i.e. 3-3-4 (4-5-5) sts on each side of both markers) = 42-47-49 (54-56-60) sts remain on front and back piece. Cut the yarn.

YOKE:
Insert 1 marker – NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE.
Beg mid back and K over sts on half back piece, cast on 36-38-44 (46-50-56) sts over one armhole, K over front piece, cast on 36-38-44 (46-50-56) sts over the other armhole and K until mid back again = 156-170-186 (200-212-232) sts. Now work piece back and forth on circular needle from mid back as follows: K 3 rows while AT THE SAME TIME on 1st row (= WS) dec 2-2-4 (4-2-8) sts evenly = 154-168-182 (196-210-224) sts. Work next row as follows from RS: 2 edge sts in garter st, work pattern according to diagram A.4 until 5 sts remain, finish with the first 3 sts in A.4 and 2 edge sts in garter st. Continue pattern like this. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 3-4-5 (6-7-8) cm from marker, dec all 4 P to 3 P by P the first 2 sts in every P-section tog. Repeat dec in every P-section when piece measures 5-6-7 (8-9-10) and 6-7-8 (9-10-11) cm = 91-99-107 (115-123-131) sts remain and there is only 1 P between every eyelet row. When piece measures approx. 7-8-9 (10-11-12) cm – adjust so that next row is a row with holes, work A.3 from RS over all sts (continue 2 edge sts in garter st as before) = 44-48-52 (56-60-64) sts remain.

NECK EDGE:
