SKIRT:
Cast on 124-134-144-154-164 stitches with circular needle size 3 mm and Fabel. Work 6 cm stocking stitch. The next round is worked as follows: Fold the cast-on edge toward the back, so that the 6 cm which have been worked lie double (with the right side outwards). Work 1 stitch from the needle, AT THE SAME TIME work this stitch together with 1 stitch from the cast-on edge, continue in this way until there are 4 stitches left, work 4 stitches without working the cast-on edge as well (= hole to thread the elastic through). Change to circular needle size 4 mm, knit 1 round where you decrease 4 stitches evenly along the round = 120-130-140-150-160 stitches. Insert 10 marker threads in the piece, with 11-12-13-14-15 stitches between each (insert the marker threads in one stitch). Continue working stocking stitch, AT THE SAME TIME increase 1 stitch with a yarn over on the right side of each marker thread, increase every 2nd round, a total of 27-33-40-48-56 times = 390-460-540-630-720 stitches – the increased stitches are knitted on the next round so that they make holes. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! After the last increase (the piece measures approx. 22-26-31-37-42 cm) loosely cast off in knit as follows: Knit 1, ((** push the right-hand needle in between the first 2 stitches on the left needle (in other words, between the stitches on the needle, not through the stitches), make 1 yarn over the right needle, pull the yarn over out between the stitches and place it on the left needle **, repeat from **-** 2 more times (= 3 new stitches on the left needle). * Knit the first stitch on the left needle, pass the first stitch on the right needle over the last stitch knitted *)), repeat from *-* a total of 6 times and repeat from ((-)) along the whole skirt until there is 1 stitch remaining, cut the strand and pull it through the last stitch.
