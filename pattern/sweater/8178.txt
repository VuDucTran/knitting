Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comINFORMATION FOR PATTERN:

GARTER STITCH (worked in the round):
1 ridge = 2 rounds. Knit 1 round and purl 1 round.

PATTERN:
Tunic: See diagrams A.1 to A.5. Choose diagram for your size.
Head band: See diagram A.6.
Work the entire pattern in stocking stitch.

INCREASE/DECREASE TIP:
To calculate how to increase/decrease evenly, use the total number of stitches on round (e.g. 76 stitches) and divide stitches by number of increases/decreases to be done (e.g. 8) = 9.5.
In this example increase after alternately approx. every 9th and 10th stitch by making 1 yarn over. On next round knit yarn overs twisted to avoid holes. 
If decreasing knit alternately approx. every 8th and 9th stitch and every 9th and 10th stitch together. 

ELEVATION:
Insert 1 marker at beginning of round = mid back. Begin from right side with rose and knit as before until 6-6-7-7-8-8 stitches have been worked past marker, turn, tighten yarn and purl 12-12-14-14-16-16. Turn, tighten yarn and knit 18-18-21-21-24-24, turn, tighten yarn and purl 24-24-28-28-32-32. Turn, tighten yarn and knit 30-30-35-35-40-40, turn, tighten yarn and purl 36-36-42-42-48-48. Turn piece, tighten yarn and knit until mid back.

KNITTING TIP-1:
To avoid the knitting tension to tighten when working pattern, it is important not to tighten the strands on back side of piece. Switch to a higher needle number when working pattern if the pattern is somewhat tight.

KNITTING TIP-2 (applies to yoke on tunic):
If knitting tension is incorrect in height and there are more rows vertically on 10 cm than stated in pattern the round yoke will be too short and the armholes too small. To avoid this work 1 extra round in stocking stitch evenly in the unicoloured sections on yoke.

KNITTING TIP-3:
Tunic can be worked to desired length. If you want it longer, continue increase in each side the same way as before until desired measurements.

INCREASE TIP (applies to sides of body):
Increase 1 stitch on each side of marker thread in each side as follows: Begin 10 stitches before marker thread, make 1 yarn over, knit 20 (marker thread is in the middle of these 20 stitches), make 1 yarn over (= 2 stitches increased). On next round knit yarn overs twisted to avoid holes.

DECREASE TIP (applies to mid under sleeve):
Begin 2 stitches before marker thread and knit 2 together, marker thread, slip 1 stitch knitwise, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over stitch worked (= 2 stitches decreased).
----------------------------------------------------------

TUNIC:
Worked in the round on circular needle, top down. Work sleeves in the round on double pointed needles. Rounds begin mid back.

NECK EDGE:
Cast on 76-78-80-82-84-86 stitches on a short circular needle size 4 mm with rose. Switch to circular needle size 3 mm and work 2 ridges in GARTER STITCH - see explanation above. Then knit 2 round while AT THE SAME TIME increasing 8-6-10-8-12-10 stitches evenly - read INCREASE/DECREASE TIP = 84-84-90-90-96-96 stitches. Then work yoke as explained below.

YOKE:
Switch back to circular needle size 4 mm and work ELEVATION at the back of neck - see explanation above. When elevation has been worked, finish by knitting 0-2-0-2-0-2 rounds with rose. Read KNITTING TIP-1 AND KNITTING TIP-2!
Then work A.1 in the round (= 14-14-15-15-16-16 repetitions of 6 stitches). Continue pattern and increase as shown in diagram. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! On round marked with arrow-1 in A.1 there are 126-126-135-135-144-144 stitches on needle. Work round as shown in diagram and increase AT THE SAME TIME 10-16-18-18-20-26 stitches evenly on this round = 136-142-153-153-164-170 stitches. Continue A.1 and increase AT THE SAME TIME 8-14-15-15-16-22 stitches on round marked with arrow-2 in A.1 = 144-156-168-168-180-192 stitches. After A.1 work A.2 in the round (= 12-13-14-14-15-16 repetitions of 12 stitches). Continue pattern and increase as shown in diagram. On round marked with arrow-3 (last round in A.2) there are 192-208-224-224-240-256 stitches on needle. Work round as shown in diagram and increase AT THE SAME TIME 14-10-6-10-6-2 stitches evenly on this round (increasing base colour in pattern stripe) = 206-218-230-234-246-258 stitches. Piece measures now approx. 16-17-18-19-20-21 cm from cast-on edge mid front. On next round work as explained below:

Work with off white as follows: 29-31 stitches in stocking stitch (= ½ back piece), slip the next 45-47 stitches on 1 stitch holder for sleeve, cast on 6-6 new stitches on needle (= in the side under sleeve), work 58-62 stitches in stocking stitch (= front piece), slip the next 45-47 stitches on 1 stitch holder for sleeve, cast on 6-6 new stitches on needle (= in the side under sleeve) and work the remaining 29-31 stitches in stocking stitch (= ½ back piece).
SIZE 5/6, 7/8, 9/10 and 11/12 YEARS:

ALL SIZES:
Cut the strand. Finish body and sleeves separately. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE!  

BODY:
= 128-136-144-152-160-168 stitches. Insert 1 marker thread in the middle of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches that were cast on under sleeve in each side. Begin round at one marker and read the rest of body before continuing!
SIZE 2, 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8 years: 
Work A.3 in the round (= 16-17-18-19 repetitions of 8 stitches). When A.3 has been worked, work A.4 in the round. When A.4 has been worked, work in stocking stitch with dark rose until finished measurements.
SIZE 9/10 and 11/12 years: 
Work A.4 in the round (= 20-21 repetitions of 8 stitches). When A.4 has been worked, work in stocking stitch with dark rose until finished measurements.  

ALL SIZES: AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 4-4-4-4-3-3 cm, increase 2 stitches in each side - read INCREASE TIP (= 4 stitches increased). Increase like this every 8th-9th-8th-9th-8th-9th round (approx. every 3 cm) 8-8-10-10-12-12 times in total in each side = 160-168-184-192-208-216 stitches. NOTE! Work the increased stitches in dark rose, i.e. when increasing, there will be more stitches in dark rose between dots in A.4. 
When piece measures approx. 25-28-31-34-37-40 cm from division - read KNITTING TIP-3, work 2 ridges. Then loosely cast off. Tunic measures approx. 42-46-50-54-58-62 cm from shoulder and down. 

SLEEVE:
Slip the 45-47-49-49-51-53 stitches from stitch holder in one side of piece on double pointed needles size 4 mm and pick in addition up 1 new stitch in each of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches cast on under sleeve = 51-53-55-57-59-61 stitches on needle. Insert a marker thread in the middle of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches under sleeve and 1 marker thread in the middle stitch on round (= mid on top of sleeve. Read the rest of sleeve before continuing!
SIZE 2, 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8 years:
Begin at marker thread mid under sleeve and work A.3 in the round but note that the pattern will not fit an entire repetition mid under sleeve.  Begin with 3rd-2nd-1st-8th stitch in A.3 and repeat A.3 in the round as long as you can. Pattern will be symmetrical mid under sleeve and stitch with marker thread mid on top of sleeve should now fit 4th stitch in A.3. After A.3 work in stocking stitch with dark rose.
SIZE 9/10 and 11/12 years:
Begin at marker thread mid under sleeve and work in stocking stitch with dark rose.

ALL SIZES: AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 3-3-2-2-2-2 cm from division, decrease 2 stitches mid under sleeve - read DECREASE TIP. Decrease like this every 2-2-2½-3½-3½-3½ cm 7-8-9-8-9-10 times in total = 37-37-37-41-41-41 stitches. When piece measures 16-19-23-27-31-34 cm from division (decreases should be done), knit 1 round while decreasing 1 stitch in all sizes = 36-36-36-40-40-40 stitches. Work A.5 in the round (= 9-9-9-10-10-10 repetitions of 4 stitches). After A.5 switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm. Work 2 ridges in the round with dark rose, switch back to double pointed needles size 4 mm and cast off. Sleeve measures approx. 21-24-28-32-36-39 cm from division. Work the other sleeve the same way.
