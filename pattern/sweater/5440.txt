JUMPER:
Worked in the round on circular needle. 

BODY: 
Cast on 102-114-126 (138-150) sts on circular needle size 3.5 mm with 2 threads Alpaca. Work 1 round in stocking st, then continue with RIB for 3 cm - see explanation above. Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work 1 round in stocking st. Work next round as follows: 11-14-17 (20-23) sts in stocking st, insert a marker in the first of these sts (= the side), diagram M.1 (= 33 sts), work 11-14-17 (20-23) sts in stocking st, insert a marker in the last of these sts (= the side), work 47-53-59 (65-71) sts in stocking st. Continue to work like this until piece measures 16-17-20 (23-25) cm. Now cast off 5 sts in each side for armholes (= st with marker + 2 sts on each side of this st) = 49-55-61 (67-73) sts on front piece and 43-49-55 (61-67) sts on back piece. Put piece aside and knit the sleeves. 

SLEEVE: 
Cast on 30-30-36 (36-36) sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm with 2 threads Alpaca. Work 1 round in stocking st, continue with rib for 3 cm.

At the same time when piece measures 6 cm, inc 2 sts mid under sleeve, repeat every 3-2-3 (2.5-2.5) cm a total of 4-6-5 (7-9) times = 38-42-46 (50-54) sts. When piece measures 17-19-20 (25-29) cm, cast off 5 sts mid under sleeve = 33-37-41 (45-49) sts. Put piece aside and knit another sleeve. 

YOKE:

Then continue the piece with or without button holes – see explanation below.

At the same time when piece measures 23-25-29 (32-35) cm, slip the middle 13-13-13 (15-15) sts in the front on a stitch holder for neck and work each side separate. Continue to cast off towards the neck on every other row: 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2-2-2 (3-3) times. After all dec for raglan and cast offs for neck, a total of 45-49-53 (53-57) sts remain on needle.

When piece measures 8-10 (11) cm work next round as follows: * 1 dc in each of the first 6 sts, then work the next 2 dc tog – SEE EXPLANATION ABOVE *, repeat from *-* the entire round (8-9 (10) dc dec on round). Repeat dec every other round a total of 5 times = 24-27 (30) dc on round. Switch to Vienna and work 2-2 (3) rounds without dec. Switch to 2 threads Alpaca and work until piece measures 20-22-24 cm. On next round dec 4-4 (4) dc evenly on round = 20-23 (26) dc on round.  Work 4-4 (7) cm without dec, piece now measures approx. 24-26 (31) cm. 
On next round dec 4-4 (5) dc evenly on round = 16-19 (21) dc. Work 3-4 (4) cm without dec. On next round dec 2-3 (3) dc evenly on round = 14-16 (18) dc. Work 1 cm without dec. 
On next round crochet all dc tog 2 by 2 = 7-8 (9) dc remain on round. Cut the thread, thread it through the last sts and tighten tog. The hat measures approx. 31-32 (37) cm from the top down.
