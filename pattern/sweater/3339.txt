Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comKnitting tension: 14 sts x 16 rows on needle size 7 mm with 1 thread Safran and 2 threads Alpaca (= 3 threads) in stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm.
Rib: * K2, P3 *, repeat from *-*.
Decreasing tip (applies to raglan): 
All decreases are done from RS!
Dec as follows on each transition between sleeve and back and front pieces (start 3 sts before marking thread (MT)): K2 tog, K2, (MT placed in middle of these 2 sts), slip 1 st as if to knit, K1, psso. 
Knitting tip: If knitting tension is incorrect in height and knitting is too tight the raglan decrease will be to short and armhole too small. Adjust this by knitting 1 extra round without dec every so often between decreases.  

Back and front pieces: Knit piece in the round. Cast on 95-100-105-115-120 sts on circular needle size 7 mm with 1 thread of each colour (= 3 threads) and K1 round. Knit Rib until piece measures 5-5-6-7-7 cm – see explanation above. Continue in stocking sts at the same time as adjusting sts number to 94-100-106-114-120 on 1st round after Rib. Insert 1 MT on each side = 47-50-53-57-60 sts between MT. When piece measures 8 cm inc 1 sts on each side of each MT on every 10 -11 -12 -13 -14 cm  2 times in total = 102 -108-114-122-128 sts. When piece measures 24-26-28-30-32 cm cast off 6 sts on each side for armhole (i.e. 3 sts on each side of each MT) = 45-48-51-55-58 sts left in total for front and back pieces. Leave piece to one side and knit sleeves.

Sleeve: Cast on 25-25-30-35-35 sts loosely on double pointed needles size 7 mm with 1 thread of each colour (= 3 threads) and K1 round. Then knit Rib until piece measures 5-5-6-7-7 cm. Continue in stocking sts at the same time as adjusting sts number to 28-28-30-34-34 on 1st round after Rib. When piece measures 15 cm inc 2 sts mid under sleeve every 3-3-3.5-3-4.5-4 cm in total of  7-8-8-7-8 times = 42-44-46-48-50 sts. When piece measures 34-38-42-44-46 cm cast off 6 sts mid under arm = 36-38-40-42-44 sts. Leave piece to one side and knit another sleeve. 

Yoke: Slip sleeves onto same circular needle as back and front pieces where sts are cast off for armhole = 162-172-182-194-204 sts. Insert 1 MT in all transition between sleeves and back and front pieces. Begin raglan dec on next round. 
Read next 2 sections before knitting commences!

Raglan decrease: Read Knitting tip! Dec 1 sts on each side of all MT (= 8 decreases). Dec on every 2nd round – read Decreasing tip: 10-11-12-13-14 times. 

Neckline: At the same time when piece measures 32-35-38-41-44 cm slip middle 9-10-11-11-12 sts onto 1 thread or stitch holder. Now dec 1 sts on every other row 2 times to shape neckline. After all dec for raglan and neck 69-70-71-75-76 sts are left on row. Pick up approx 16 to 20 sts (incl sts from thread or stitch holder) at neck front with 1 thread of each colour (= 3 threads) and slip all sts onto double pointed needles size 7 mm. K1 round at the same time adjust sts amount to 75-75-75-80-80 sts. P1 round before continuing in Rib - see explanation above. When neck edge measures 5 cm cast off loosely, K over K and P over P.
