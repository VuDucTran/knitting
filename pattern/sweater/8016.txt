All decreases are worked from the right side! Decrease 1 stitch on the inside of 4 edge stitches in garter stitch in each side. 
Decrease as follows after the 4 edge stitches in garter stitch: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch (= 1 stitch decreased).
Decrease as follows before the 4 edge stitches in garter stitch: Work until there are 6 stitches left on the needle, knit 2 together and then work the 4 edge stitches in garter stitch (= 1 stitch decreased).

BUTTONHOLES:
Decrease for the buttonholes on the left button band at the back (when the garment is worn). 1 buttonhole = start from the right side, knit 1, knit 2 together, make 1 yarn over and knit the last band stitch. On the next row, knit the yarn over so that there is a hole.

SINGLET:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle up to the armholes, then work the front and back pieces separately, back and forth on the circular needle to finished length.

BODY:
Cast on a little loosely 100-108-120 (128-140-148) stitches with circular needle size 2.5 mm and light sea green. Work 3 RIDGES – see description above. Change to circular needle size 3 mm and work stocking stitch. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 7-8-9 (10-12-14) cm work STRIPES – see description above. Repeat A.1 in height. When the piece measures approx. 15- 16-17 (19-21-24) cm continue working with off white to finished length. AT THE SAME TIME on the first round after the stripes, insert  1 marker thread at the beginning of the round and 1 marker thread after 50-54-60 (64-70-74) stitches (= in the sides – allow the marker threads to follow your work  upwards as you go). When the piece measures 16-17-18 (20-22-25) cm work 2 ridges over 14 stitches in each side (in other words 7 stitches on each side of both marker threads – the other stitches are continued in stocking stitch). After the 2 ridges in each side, work the next round as follows: Cast off 3 stitches for the armhole, knit 44-48-54 (58-64-68) stitches (= front piece), cast off 6 stitches for the armhole, knit 44-48-54 (58-64-68) stitches (= back piece) and cast off the last 3 stitches for the armhole. Cut the strand. The front and back pieces are now worked separately.

FRONT PIECE:
= 44-48-54 (58-64-68) stitches. Work stocking stitch back and forth with 4 edge stitches in garter stitch in each side (the first row is worked from the wrong side). When you have worked 3 rows back and forth (i.e. the last row was worked from the wrong side) decrease for the armholes in each side – READ DECREASE TIP (= 2 stitches decreased). Decrease in this way every 4th row (i.e. every other row from the right side) a total of 4 times in each side = 36-40-46 (50-56-60) stitches. Continue with stocking stitch and 4 edge stitches in garter stitch in each side until the piece measures 23-24-26 (28-30-33) cm. Now place the middle 14-16-16 (16-18-20) stitches on 1 thread for the neck and finish each shoulder separately. Cast off for the neck at the beginning of each row from the neck as follows: 2 stitches 1 time in all sizes and then 1 stitch 2-2-2 (3-3-4) times = 7-8-11 (12-14-14) stitches left on the shoulder. Continue working until there is 1 row left before the piece measures 26-28-30 (33-36-40) cm (adjust so that the next row is worked from the wrong side). Knit 1 row from the wrong side and then cast off in knit from the right side. Work the other shoulder in the same way.

BACK PIECE:
= 44-48-54 (58-64-68) stitches. Insert 1 marker thread after the first 22-24-27 (29-32-34) stitches (= mid back). Continue working in the same way as for the front piece and decrease for the armholes in each side every 4th row. AT THE SAME TIME when the piece measures 18-20-22 (23-26-30) cm place the stitches on the right hand side of the piece (seen from the right side) up to the marker thread on a thread.

LEFT BACK PIECE (when the garment is worn):
Work stocking stitch back and forth as before with 4 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the armhole and, in addition, cast on 2 new stitches at the end of the first row from the wrong side towards mid back. Continue with stocking stitch, 4 edge stitches in garter stitch towards mid back and 4 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the armhole – remember the decreases for the armhole and BUTTONHOLES on the band – see description above.
When you have worked 1 row after the last buttonhole, cast off the first 11-12-12 (13-14-16) stitches from mid back for the neck. Continue by casting off 2 stitches on the next row from the neck = 7-8-11 (12-14-14) stitches left on the shoulder. Continue until there is 1 row left before the piece measures 26-28-30 (33-36-40) cm – adjust to match the front piece. Knit 1 row from the wrong side and then cast off in knit from the right side.

RIGHT BACK PIECE:
Place the 22-24-27 (29-32-34) stitches from the thread back on circular needle size 3 mm, in addition cast on 2 new stitches at the end of the first row from the right side towards mid back = 24-26-29 (31-34-36) stitches on the needle. Continue working as for the left back piece, but with the decreases on the opposite side (do not cast off for buttonholes on the right band).

ASSEMBLY:
Sew the shoulder seams inside the cast-off edge.  

NECK:
Start mid back and knit up from the right side approx. 60-66-66 (74-82-90) stitches around the neck (including the stitches on the thread at the front) with circular needle size 2.5 mm and off white. Knit 1 row from the wrong side, knit 1 row from the right side and 1 row from the wrong side. Loosely cast off with knit from the right side.

ASSEMBLY:
Sew the buttons on the right band at the back. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
