VEST:
Piece is worked in the round on circular needle up to armhole, then finish front and back piece back and forth on circular needle.

BODY:
Cast on 128-140-148-156-168-176 sts on circular needle size 3 mm with Cotton Merino. Work 2 ridges in GARTER ST - see explanation above. Switch to circular needle size 3.5 mm and K 1 round. Insert 1 marker in first st on round and 1 marker in 65th-71st-75th-79th-85th-89th st on round (= in the sides – there are now 63-69-73-77-83-87 sts between sts with markers). Then work pattern in the round according to diagram A.1 (markers are in a P st in pattern). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION When piece measures 20-22-25-28-31-34 cm, work 2 ridges in garter st over the middle 13 sts in each side (i.e. over st with marker + 6 sts on each side of this – work the other sts as before). On first round after ridges, cast off the middle 7 sts in each side for armhole and finish front and back piece separately.

BACK PIECE:
= 57-63-67-71-77-81 sts. Continue with pattern back and forth with 3 edge sts in garter st in each side (1st row = WS). When 3 rows have been worked back and forth, dec on next row from RS for armhole in each side - READ DECREASE TIP (= 2 sts dec). Dec like this every 4th row (i.e. every other row from RS), 4 times in total = 49-55-59-63-69-73 sts. Continue pattern with 3 edge sts in garter st in each side until piece measures 31-34-38-42-46-50 cm. Now cast off the middle 25-27-29-31-33-37 sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Cast off 1 st on next row from neck = 11-13-14-15-17-17 sts remain on the shoulder. Work until 2 rows remain before piece measures 33-36-40-44-48-52 cm, adjust so that next row is worked from RS. K 1 row from RS and K 1 row from WS and then cast off with K from RS. Repeat on the other shoulder.

FRONT PIECE:
= 57-63-67-71-77-81 sts. Work as back piece and dec for armhole in the sides as on back piece = 49-55-59-63-69-73 sts. When piece measures 28-31-34-38-41-45 cm, slip the middle 15-17-17-17-17-19 sts on 1 stitch holder for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Continue to cast off for neck at beg of every row from neck as follows: Cast off 2 sts 2-2-2-2-3-3 times and 1 st 2-2-3-4-3-4 times = 11-13-14-15-17-17 sts remain on shoulder. Work until 2 row remains before piece measures 33-36-40-44-48-52 cm - adjust according to back piece. K 1 row from RS and K 1 row from WS and then cast off with K from RS. Repeat on the other shoulder.
