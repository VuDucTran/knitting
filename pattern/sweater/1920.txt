When the work measures 32-35-38 (39-41-42) cm bind off the center 10 sts in the front for the neck split.

Sleeves: Cast on 38-38-40 (42-44-46) sts on smaller double pointed needles with mustard (blue heather); join and place a marker at the join. Knit rib for 3-4-4 (4-4-4) cm and inc 4-6-8 (6-6-4) sts evenly distributed on the last row = 42-44-48 (48-50-50) sts.
Change to larger double pointed needles and knit Pattern 4 once, then repeat Pattern 1 until the work measures 21-24-28 (32-36-39) cm. At the same time, after the rib, inc 1 st each side of marker 14-16-18 (20-21-24) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 years: alternately every 3rd and 4th row
Sizes 7/8 + 9/10 + 13/14 years: every 4th row
Size 11/12 years: alternately every 4th and 5th row
= 70-76-84 (88-92-98) sts. After Pattern 1 knit Pattern 3 once, then repeat Pattern 2 to finished dimensions. When the work measures 23-26-30 (34-38-41) cm [9" - 10.25" - 11.75" (13-3/8" - 14-7/8" - 16-1/8") put 2 sts each side of marker on a stitch holder and knit the rest back and forth on the needles.
Then put 5-6-6 (7-7-7) sts on a stitch holder for sleeve caps on either side every other row 4 times. The work measures approximately 26-29-33 (37-41-44) cm. Put all sts back on the same needle and knit 2 cm reverse stockinette stitch in the round for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at the center front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and split. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 20-30 sts along the left side of the split on smaller needles with mustard (blue heather) and knit border. Repeat along the right side of the split. Fold the edges over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the split together at the bottom from the right side. Pick up approximately 80-94 sts around the neck and over the split on smaller needles with mustard (blue heather) and knit border. Fold the edge over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand. Sew on the hooks.

DROPS 3 mm and 3.5 mm double pointed needles, or sizes needed to obtain correct gauge.

Gauge: 22 sts and 30 rows on larger needle in pattern = 10 x 10 cm

Pattern: See charts (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is shown from the right side and is knit in the round. All charts are identical for all sizes.

Rib: *knit 1, purl 1*, repeat from * - *.

Socks: Cast on 44-46-48 (50-52-52) sts on smaller needles; join and place a marker at the join (this is the center back of the sock). Knit rib for 5 cm. Change to larger needles and knit 1 row stockinette stitch, increasing 4-6-4 (6-4-4) sts evenly distributed on the row = 48-52-52 (56-56-56) sts. Then establish the pattern as follows: knit 3-5-5 (7-7-7) sts of Pattern 5, Pattern 6, 3-5-5 (7-7-7) sts of Pattern 7, 1 st at the center of the back knit in stockinette stitch on all rows until the work measures 24-24-28 (27-30-32) cm [9.5" - 9.5" - 11" (10-5/8" - 11.75" - 12-5/8"). Then begin shaping the leg: Dec 1 st on each side of the stockinette stitch at the center back every 4th row: 4-5-4 (6-5-5) times = 40-42-44 (44-46-46) sts. Make the decreases as follows: Before the center stitch: slip 1, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over. After the center stitch: K 2 tog.
When the work measures 30-32-34 (36-38-40) cm, put the uppermost 22-24-26 (26-28-28) on a stitch holder and knit the heel in stockinette stitch: 5-5-5 (6-6-6) cm stockinette stitch back and forth over the center 18 sts in the back.

Turn the heel:
1st row (right side): Knit 10 sts, K 2 tog into back of stitch, knit 1, turn the work.
2nd row (wrong side): slip 1, purl 8, purl 2 tog, purl 1, turn the work.
3rd row: slip 1, knit 7, K 2 tog into back of stitch, knit 1, turn the work.
4th row: slip 1, purl 6, purl 2 tog, purl 1, turn the work.
5th row: slip 1, knit 5 sts, K 2 tog into back of stitch, knit 1, turn the work.
6th row: slip 1, purl 4, purl 2 tog, purl 1, turn the work.
7th row: K 2 tog, knit 3 sts, K 2 tog into back of stitch = 10 sts on needle.

Now pick up 11-11-11 (13-13-13) sts on either side of the heel and put all sts evenly distributed on 4 needles = 54-56-58 (62-64-64) sts. Then dec 1 st each side of the uppermost 22-24-26 (26-28-28) sts every other row: 6-6-5 (7-7-7) times = 42-44-48 (48-50-50) sts. When the foot measures 13-15-16 (17-18-20) cm from the start of the heel turning, shape the toe. Attach a marker on either side of the foot and dec 1 st on either side of the markers (4 decreases per row in all) 8-8-10 (10-10-10) times alternately every row and every other row = 10-12-8 (8-10-10) sts.
