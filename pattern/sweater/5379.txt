YOKE:
Cast on 84-88-92-96-100 sts on a short circular needle size 3 mm with red, insert a marker at beg of round (= mid back). Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 2-2-3-3-3 cm (= neck). Switch to a short circular needle size 4 mm. K 1 round while at the same time adjusting no of sts to 78-84-90-98-105. Then work an elevation at the back as follows in stocking st: K 8 sts past marker, turn, tighten thread and P 16 sts on return, turn, tighten thread and K 24 sts, turn, continue by working 8 sts more on every turn until a total of 48-48-64-64-80 sts have been worked, turn and K 1 round until marker mid back again. Then work diagram M.1 – see diagram for correct size! Switch to a longer circular needle when there are enough sts. When diagram M.1 has been worked, there are 208-224-240-252-270 sts on needle, work 0-0-1-0-1 cm more with red. Piece now measures approx. 14-15-16-17-18 cm mid front (measured without rib in the neck). Work with red and in stocking st until finished measurements. First work 1 round while at the same time inc 4-4-4-12-10 sts evenly = 212-228-244-264-280 sts. Work next round as follows: Work 31-33-35-37-39 sts, slip the next 44-48-52-58-62 sts on a stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts (insert a marker in the middle of these sts = the side), work 62-66-70-74-78 sts (= front piece), slip the next 44-48-52-58-62 sts on a stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts (insert a marker in the middle of these sts = the side), work 31-33-35-37-39 sts. 

BODY:

Repeat inc every 3-3-3½-4-4 cm a total of 10 times = 176-184-192-200-208 sts. When piece measures 33-37-41-45-49 cm (from where sts were slipped on stitch holders for sleeve), switch to circular needle size 3 mm. Work 1 round while at the same time inc 36-36-36-40-40 sts evenly = 212-220-228-240-248 sts. Then work diagram M.3. When diagram M.3 has been worked, there are 424-440-456-480-496 sts on needle.

NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE! Work in stocking st in the round with red. When sleeve measures 2 cm, dec 1 st on each side of marker. Repeat dec every 4½-3½-4-3-3½ cm a total of 5-7-7-10-10 times = 40-40-44-44-48 sts. When sleeve measures 20-24-28-31-35 cm, work diagram M.2, then switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm. Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 3 cm, then cast off with K over K and P over P.

Continue as follows: 1 st in garter st, diagram M.4 over the next 21-21-21-25-25 sts (work the last st as the first st in diagram) and 1 st in garter st. Work diagram M.4 until there are 5-5-6-6-6 lines of dots, then work diagram M.5 one time vertically over diagram M.4. Then K 4 rows (= 2 ridges) with red, then cast off. Knit another pocket.
