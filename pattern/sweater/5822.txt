BODY: 
Worked in the round on circular needle.    
Cast on 160-175-185-200-215 sts on circular needle size 2.5 mm with off white. Work rib = K 3/P 2. After 6 rounds with off white, work 2 rounds navy blue, then 2 rounds off white, 2 rounds navy blue and 2 rounds off white. Piece measures approx. 4 cm. 
Switch to circular needle size 3 mm, finish the piece with off white. Work first round as follows: K 2-3-0-1-3, insert a marker (= the side), K 11-15-18-22-25, * P 2, K 1, work 2 K sts in next st, K 1 (i.e. that 3 K sts from rib becomes 4 K sts) *, repeat from *-* a total of 5 times, P 2, K 8 (= mid front), repeat from *-* 5 times, P 2, K 11-15-18-22-25, insert a marker (= the side), work until first marker inserted in the side (= 76-83-87-94-103 sts) - while AT THE SAME TIME dec 4-3-1-0-3 sts evenly. 
There are now 166-182-194-210-222 sts on needle - 94-102-108-116-122 sts on front piece and 72-80-86-94-100 sts on back piece. Then work as follows: 11-15-18-22-25 sts in stocking st, A-1 (= 12 sts), A-2 (= 48 sts), A-3 (= 12 sts), 11-15-18-22-25 sts in stocking st (marker) and 72-80-86-94-100 sts in stocking st (= back piece). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! 
Continue pattern like this until A-2 has been worked 4-4-5-5-5 times vertically (piece measures approx. 24-24-29-29-29 cm). Work pattern one more time up to the row marked with an arrow. Work the row marked with an arrow as shown in diagram but do as follows on the middle 8 sts: Slip 4 sts on cable needle in front of piece, K 1 st from cable needle tog with 1 st from needle, do this with all 4 sts on cable needle, i.e. the middle 8 sts are dec to 4. Work as before the entire round until 3 sts remain. 
Now cast off for armholes and neck as follows: Cast off the first 6 sts (i.e 3 last on round + the 3 first on round), work the next 39-43-46-50-53 sts as before, cast off the next 6 sts (= mid front), work the next 39-43-46-50-53 sts as before, cast off 6 sts (= armhole), work the rest of round (= 66-74-80-88-94 sts). Finish front and back piece separately.

BACK PIECE: 
= 66-74-80-88-94 sts. Continue in stocking st - at the same time cast off for armholes at beg of every row in each side: 2 sts 0-1-1-2-2 times and 1 st 4-4-4-3-3 times = 58-62-68-74-80 sts remain on needle. Continue in stocking st but work the outermost st in each side K on every row. When piece measures approx. 37-38-44-45-47 cm, cast off the middle 22-22-24-26-28 sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Then cast off on every row from neck: 1 st 2 times = 16-18-20-22-24 sts remain on shoulder. Cast off when piece measures approx. 39-40-46-47-49 cm in total. 

LEFT FRONT PIECE: 
= 39-43-46-50-53 sts. Continue pattern as before but over A-2 only continue with the last 4 rows in diagram – outermost st towards mid front is worked K on all rows. At the same time cast off for armhole as on back piece and dec for neck – SEE DECREASE TIP! Repeat neck dec every row from RS until 22-24-26-28-30 sts remain on needle. Work as follows (seen from from RS): 1 st worked K on all rows, 2-4-6-8-10 sts in stocking st and A-2 as before. When piece measures approx. 39-40-46-47-49 cm (adjust to back piece), dec all 4 K sts in A-2 tog to 2 K sts (i.e. K sts tog 2 by 2) = 16-18-20-22-24 sts. On next row (= WS) cast off all sts with K over K and P over P.

RIGHT FRONT PIECE: 
Work as left front piece but reversed. 

ASSEMBLY: 
Sew the shoulder seams.

NECK EDGE: 
Worked back and forth on circular needle size 2.5 mm from mid front. Start by knitting up sts on the left side of the 6 sts cast off mid front - knit up with off white inside 1 st: Approx. 30-40 sts up to shoulder, then approx. 26-32 sts over back piece and 30-40 sts down along the other side of neck (do not knit up over the 6 sts cast off mid front) = approx. 86-112 sts. K 1 row from WS. Then K 1 row from RS while at the same time inc evenly to 105-110-115-120-125 sts. Work next row as follows from WS: 1 st worked K on all rows, * P 3, K 2 *, repeat from *-* until 4 sts remain, P 3 and 1 st worked K on all rows. From RS as follows: K 1, * K 3, P 2 *, repeat from *-*, finish with K 3 and K 1. Work a total of 4 rows in rib, switch to navy blue, work 1 row rib (from WS), then cast off with K over K and P over P. Neck edge measures approx. 2.5 cm in width. 
Place left part of neck edge over right and fasten towards the 6 sts cast off at the bottom of neck. 

ARMHOLE EDGE:
Knit up approx. 65-90 sts at the edge of one armhole on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with off white. P 1 round, then K 1 round - while at the same time adjusting no of sts to 75-80-85-90-100 sts. Continue in rib = K 3/P 2 for 4 rounds. Switch to navy blue, work 1 round in rib, then cast off with K over K and P over P. Work the same way around the other armhole.
