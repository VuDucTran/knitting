Back and front piece: 
Knit around on circular needle. Cast on 132-140-144-156-168 sts on circular needle size 4 mm with Paris. K 1 round. Insert 1 MT at the beg. of round and 1 MT after 66-70-72-78-84 sts (mid of the side). Continue with Rib K1/P1 until the piece measures 5 cm. Continue with M.1 until finish. At the same time when the piece measures 9 cm inc. 1 st each side of each MT on every 4.5-4-5-5.5-5.5 cm a total of 4-5-5-5-5 times = 148-160-164-176-188 sts (incorporate new sts in to pattern as going along). When the work measures 27-29-33-34-35 cm cast off 8 sts each side for the arm holes (i.e. 4 sts each side of the MT) = 132-144-148-160-172 sts left in total for the back and the front piece. Insert a MT at the mid front (= after 33-36-37-40-43 sts). Put work aside.

Sleeve: Cast on 42-42-48-48-48 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with Paris. K 1 round. Insert a MT at the beg. of round (=mid underneath the sleeve). Continue in Rib K1/P1 until the piece measures 4 cm. Then continue with M.1. When the piece measures 6-8-8-8-6 cm inc. 1 st each side of the MT underneath the sleeve on every 3-2.5-3.5-3-3 cm a total of 10-12-10-12-14 times = 62-66-68-72-76 sts. At the same time when the piece measures 14-15-16-17-18 cm knit M.2 1 time vertically and continue with M.1. Repeat M.2 when the piece measures 25-28-30-31-33 cm. When the piece measures 35-39-42-45-48 cm cast off the mid 8 sts underneath the sleeve (i.e. 4 sts each side of the MT ) =54-58-60-64-68 sts. Put work aside and knit another sleeve.

Yoke: Insert the sleeves on the same circular needle as the front and back piece where you cast off for arm holes = 240-260-268-288-308 sts. Insert a MT in each transition between body and sleeve (insert the MT in the first and the last st on the sleeves) = 4 MT. Continue with M.1. Knit 1 round before starting the dec. for the raglan.
Raglan dec: Dec. 1 st each side of the 4 MT (= 8 dec.) – read decreasing tips. Dec on every other round 15-15-17-17-18 times and on every round 4-6-5-7-8 times.
At the same time when the piece measures 32-34-38-39-40 cm cast off the mid 4 sts at the front for neck (2 sts each side of the MT) – knit the piece back on forth from this point onwards. Continue to cast off 1 st towards the neck on every 4th row 2 times and on every other row until finish (the neck dec. can overlap the raglan dec which means there becomes less raglan dec. at the front piece than the back piece). After all dec. for the raglan and the neck are completed there are approx. 64-68 sts left. Knit 1 row at the same time dec evenly distributed on row the number of sts to 54-56-56-58-60 sts. The work measures approx. 45-48-53-55-57 cm up to the shoulder.

Neck: Knit round on needle.
Rolling edge: Pick up approx 38 to 52 sts where you cast off for the neck = 92 to 112 sts on needle. Continue with 5 rounds of stocking sts before cast off loosely with K1/P1.
Rib: Pick up 72 to 90 sts from behind the rolling edge. Knit K3/P3 for 3 cm cast off with K over K and P over P
