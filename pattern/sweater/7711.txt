When piece measures 3 cm, inc 1 st on each side of markers (= 4 sts inc). Inc every 7-9-10-12-13 cm 3 times in total = 150-158-166-174-182 sts. Continue to work until piece measures 19-23-26-29-32 cm. Work A.2 with one edge st in each side. Switch to circular needle size 3 mm.

AT THE SAME TIME after 1 cm, cast off for 6-6-7-7-7 button holes evenly. 1 button hole = work 2 sts tog and make 1 YO (casting off P 2 seen from RS will look more pretty).
