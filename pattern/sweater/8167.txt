Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comINFORMATION FOR PATTERN:

GARTER STITCH (worked in the round):
1 ridge = 2 rounds. Knit 1 round and purl 1 round. 

PATTERN:
See diagram A.1. 

INCREASE TIP:
Work until 1 stitch remains before marker thread. Make 1 yarn over, knit 2 (marker is between these 2 stitches), make 1 yarn over (= 2 stitches increased). On next round work yarn overs twisted to avoid holes - work the increased stitches in A.1.

RAGLAN:
Decrease for raglan in every transition between sleeves and body. 
Begin 3 stitches before marker thread and knit 2 together, knit 2 (marker thread is between these 2 stitches), slip 1 stitch knitwise, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over stitch worked (= 2 stitches decreased).

DECREASE TIP:
To calculate how to decrease evenly, use the total number of stitches on round (e.g. 100 stitches) and divide stitches by number of decreases to be done (e.g. 19) = 5.3. 
In this example knit approx. every 4th and 5th stitch together.
----------------------------------------------------------

JUMPER:
Worked in the round on circular needle.

BODY:
Cast on 156-168-174-186-192-204 stitches on circular needle size 2.5 mm with Baby Merino. Knit 1 round, then work rib as follows: purl 1, * knit 1, purl 2 *, repeat from *-* until 2 stitches remain on round, finish with knit 1 and purl 1.  Continue rib like this for 4 cm. Switch to circular needle size 3 mm and work A.1 in the round over all stitches. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 20-23-26-29-32-35 cm, work next round as follows: Cast off 4 stitches for armhole, work 70-76-79-85-88-94 stitches (= front piece), cast off 8 stitches for armhole, work 70-76-79-85-88-94 stitches (= back piece) and cast off the last 4 stitches on needle for armhole. Put piece aside and work the sleeves.

SLEEVE:
Work in the round on double pointed needles/a short circular needle.
Cast on 42-42-42-48-48-48 stitches on double pointed needles size 2.5 mm with Baby Merino. Knit 1 round, then work rib as follows: purl 1, * knit 1, purl 2 *, repeat from *-* until 2 stitches remain on round, finish with knit 1 and purl 1. Continue rib like this for 4 cm. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work A.1 in the round over all stitches. Insert 1 marker thread at beginning of round (= mid under sleeve). When piece measures 6 cm, increase 1 stitch on each side of marker thread - read INCREASE TIP! Repeat increase every 2½-2½-2½-3-3-2½  cm 7-9-10-9-11-13 times in total = 56-60-62-66-70-74 stitches. When piece measures approx. 23-28-31-35-39-42 cm (adjust to finish on same round in A.1 as on body), cast off 8 stitches mid under sleeve (cast off 4 stitches on each side of marker thread) = 48-52-54-58-62-66 stitches. Put piece aside and knit another sleeve.

YOKE:
Slip sleeves on to same circular needle as body where armholes were cast off (without working the stitches first) = 236-256-266-286-300-320 stitches on needle. Insert 1 marker thread in all transitions between sleeves and body piece (= 4 marker threads). 

RAGLAN: 
Continue pattern in the round as before. Work in the round over all stitches for 2 cm. On next round decrease for RAGLAN – see explanation above (= 8 stitches decreased). Continue decrease for raglan every other round until decrease has been done 17-19-20-22-24-26 times in total on each side of all marker threads.
After all decreases for raglan there are 100-104-106-110-108-112 stitches on needle and piece measures approx. 36-40-44-48-52-56 cm up to shoulder.

NECK EDGE: 
Switch to circular needle size 2.5 mm. Work 1 ridge in GARTER STITCH in the round over all stitches, AT THE SAME TIME on first round in ridge decrease 19-17-13-11-6-7 stitches evenly – read DECREASE TIP = 81-87-93-99-102-105 stitches. Work rib = knit 1/purl 2 for 3 cm, then cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl.
