After Pattern 3 is complete, knit Pattern 4. When the work measures 40-44-46 (51-51-55) cm, bind off the center front 24-24-26 (26-28-28) sts for the neck and knit the rest back and forth on the needles. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 3 sts 1 time, 2 sts 1 time, 1 st 1 time. At the same time, when the work measures 42-46-49 (54-54-58) cm, bind off the center back 32-32-34 (34-36-36) sts for the neck. Then bind off 2 sts at each back neck edge on the next row.

After Pattern 2 knit Pattern 5 once - the work measures approximately 25-29-33 (36-40-42) cm. Now knit 2 cm reverse stockinette stitch for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body. Bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 82-98 sts around the neck on smaller double pointed needles with coal gray; join and knit rib for 6 cm. Fold the rib over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand.
