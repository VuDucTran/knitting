BODY:
Worked in the round on circular needle. Cast on 148-156-176-184-204 sts on circular needle size 3 mm with Lima. K 1 round, then work rib = K 2/P 2. When rib measures 5 cm, K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 28-28-32-32-36 sts evenly = 120-128-144-152-168 sts. Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work in stocking st. AT THE SAME TIME insert a marker at beg of round and a marker after 60-64-72-76-84 sts (these marks the sides). Insert in addition a marker mid front (i.e. after 30-32-36-38-42 sts). When piece measures 6-7-8-9-8 cm, inc 1 st on each side of both markers in the sides (= 4 sts inc). Repeat inc in the sides every 5½-6-7-7-8 cm 2 more times = 132-140-156-164-180 sts. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 9-10-11-12-12 cm, work 6-7-8-8-8 sts past marker mid front. Slip the next 16-20-20-24-24 sts on a stitch holder for pocket slit, cast on 16-20-20-24-24 new sts on needle and then continue in the round over all sts as before (remove the marker mid front). When piece measures 18-20-23-24-25 cm, work diagram A.1. When A.1 has been worked 1 time vertically, continue with diagram A.2 until finished measurements. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 22-24-27-28-29 cm, work next round as follows: Work 34-36-40-42-46 sts, slip the last 2 sts worked on a stitch holder and work the remaining 98-104-116-122-134 sts. Then work back and forth on needle from mid front. AT THE SAME TIME on next row from RS, dec 1 st at the beg and end of row for V-neck - read DECREASE TIP 1. Repeat dec every other row (i.e. every row from RS) 5 more times and then every 4th row (i.e. every other row from RS) 5-5-5-7-7 times. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 24-26-29-30-31 cm, cast off 6 sts in each side for armholes (i.e. 3 sts on each side of both markers) and finish front and back piece separately.

Continue pattern with 1 edge st in GARTER ST - see explanation above - in each side. When piece measures 36-39-43-45-47 cm, cast off the middle 20-20-20-24-24 sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Then cast off 2 sts on next row from neck = 10-12-14-14-16 sts remain on shoulder. When piece measures 38-41-45-47-49 cm, cast off with K over K and P over P.

When pocket slit measures approx. 2.5 cm, loosely cast off with K over K and P over P. Sew pocket slit neatly to front piece with duplicate sts in each side. Sew pocket opening to bottom of pocket slit (where sts were put on a stitch holder) on the back of piece.
