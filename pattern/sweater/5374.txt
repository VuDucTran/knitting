YOKE:
Cast on 84-88-92-96-100 sts on a short circular needle size 3 mm with dark grey or green. Insert a marker at beg of round (= mid back). Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 3-3-4-4-5 cm (= neck edge). Switch to a short circular needle size 4 mm. K 1 round while at the same time adjusting the no of sts to 78-84-90-98-105. Then work an elevation at the back in stocking st as follows: K 8 sts past marker, turn, tighten thread and P 16 sts on return, turn, tighten thread and K 24 sts, turn, continue by working 8 sts more on every turn until a total of 48-48-64-64-80 sts have been worked, turn and K 1 round until marker mid back again. Then work diagram M.1 – see diagram for correct size! Switch to a longer circular needle when there are enough sts. When diagram M.1 has been worked, there are 208-224-240-252-270 sts on needle. Work 0-0-1-0-1 cm more with dark grey or green.  Piece now measures approx. 14-15-16-17-18 cm mid front (measured without rib in the neck). Finish piece in dark grey or green and stocking st. First work 1 round while at the same time inc 4-4-4-12-10 sts evenly = 212-228-244-264-280 sts. Work next round as follows: Work 31-33-35-37-39 sts, slip the next 44-48-52-58-62 sts on a stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts, work 62-66-70-74-78 sts (= front piece), slip the next 44-48-52-58-62 sts on a stitch holder for sleeve (without working them first), cast on 6 new sts, work 31-33-35-37-39 sts.
