Pattern: See charts. The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette st. The charts are placed sideways on the page, with the bottom of the charts closest to the inside edge of the page.


Body: The cardigan is knit in the round after the rib with steeks cut at center front and for armholes.
Cast on 226-244-268-286-316 sts on smaller circular needles with pink /light old pink. Knit 1 row of Rib-1, keeping 1 st at each edge in garter st throughout and beginning rib with K 2 after the 1 garter st. Change to beige / light grey purple and continue in Rib-1. When the piece measures 2 cm dec all P 4 ribs to P 3 = 189-204-224-239-264 sts. When the piece measures 4 cm  dec all P 3 ribs to P 2 = 152-164-180-192-212 sts. You are now knitting Rib-2. When the piece measures 6 cm change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 7-7-3-3-7 sts evenly distributed on the row and cast on 3 new sts at center front (these 3 sts + 2 edge sts = 5 steek sts which are not knit in the pattern) = 162-174-186-198-222 sts. Join and continue with beige / light grey purple in stockinette st over all sts. When the piece measures 8-9-11-12-13 cm knit Pattern 1 (except over steek sts). After Pattern 1 knit the rest with pink.

At the same time when the piece measures 25-27-29-31-32 cm knit the next row as follows: 5 steek sts, 36-39-42-44-49 st for the front, bind off 6-6-6-8-10 sts for armhole, 73-79-85-89-99 sts for the back, bind off 6-6-6-8-10 sts for armhole, 36-39-42-44-49 sts for the front. On the next row cast on 5 new sts over the bound-off armhole sts at each side (these 5 sts are for the armhole steek and are not knit in the pattern) = 160-172-184-192-212 sts.

Now dec 1 st for armhole at each side of the 5 armhole steek sts at each side every other row 4-5-7-8-12 times = 144-152-156-160-164 sts remain on needles. When the piece measures 36-38-41-44-45 cm bind off 17-17-17-19-19 sts (incl. 5 steek sts) at center front for neck = 127-135-139-141-145 sts and knit the rest back and forth on the needles.

Now bind off at each neck edge every other row: 3 sts 1 time, 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 3-4-4-4-4 times = 111-117-121-123-127 sts remain on needles. When the piece measures 38-41-44-47-49 cm  bind off the 25-27-27-29-29 sts at center back for the neck. Then bind off 2 sts at each back neck edge on the next row. Bind off the remaining 41-43-45-45-47 sts on each side (incl. 5 armhole steek sts) when the piece measures 40-43-46-49-51 cm

Sleeve: Cast on 40-44-44-48-48 sts on smaller double-pointed needles with pink / light old pink. Join and place a marker at the join. Knit 1 row of Rib-2, change to beige / light grey purple and continue the rib. When the piece measures 5 cm change to larger double-pointed needles. Continue with Pattern 2 - centering the pattern on sleeves. At the same time when the piece measures 7 cm inc 1 st each side of marker 12-12-15-16-18 times:
Size 3/4: alternately every 5th and 6th row.
Size 5/6: alternately every 6th and 7th row.
Sizes 7/8, 9/10 and 11/12: every 6 rows
= 64-68-74-80-84 sts. After Pattern 2 is complete, knit the rest with pink / light old pink. When the piece measures 30-34-38-41-44 cm bind off 3 sts each side of marker and knit back and forth on needles. Now put sts on a st holder at each side for sleeve caps every other row: 3 sts 1 time, then 2 sts at each side until the piece measures 35-39-44-48-52 cm Put all sts from st holders back on the same needles and knit 2 cm reverse stockinette st back and forth on needles (for seam allowance over cut edge on body), increasing 12 sts evenly distributed on first row. Bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at the center front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 st from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 st from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and at the center front.

Left button band: Pick up approx. 110 to 135 sts along left front on smaller needles with pink / light old pink. P 1 row (seen from the right side) then continue in stockinette st. When button band measures 2 cm  P 1 row (seen from the right side) for folding edge, then knit 2 cm stockinette st, bind off.

Right button band: Knit the same as the left, but after 1 cm make 5-5-6-6-6 buttonholes evenly distributed along button band - put bottom buttonhole approx. 9 cm from bottom edge and top buttonhole approx. 1 cm  from top edge.
1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on on the next row. Make corresponding buttonholes on facing after folding edge. Fold button bands against wrong side and sew in place.

Collar: Pick up from right side: approx. 68 to 80 sts (divisible by 4) around the neck (including over button bands) on smaller circular needles with pink / light old pink. K 1 row, then knit Rib-2, keeping 1 st at each edge in garter st throughout and beginning with K 2 after the edge st. When the collar measures 2.5 cm inc all P 2 ribs to P 3 and when the collar measures 5 cm  inc all P 3 ribs to P 4. Continue in Rib-1 until the collar measures 8 cm ; bind off in pattern.
