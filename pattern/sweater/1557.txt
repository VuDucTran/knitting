Border: Knit 3 cm  stockinette st, purl 1 row (= folding edge - measure the work from here), knit 3 cm  stockinette st.

Body: Knit the cardigan in the round on circular needles after the seed st border and cut steeks for armholes and at the center front afterwards. Cast on 134-144-154 (164-174) sts on smaller circular needles with natural and knit 3 cm  seed st back and forth on needle. Change to larger circular needles; join and place a marker at the join. Change to stockinette st, and increase 26-24-30 (28-34) sts evenly distributed on 1st row, plus inc 5 sts at the center front (these sts are for the steek and are not knit into the pattern) = 160-168-184 (192-208) sts (+ 5 center steek sts). Then knit pattern (start at the appropriate arrow for the size you are making). When the work measures 24-28-30 (29-30) cm , inc 4 sts on each side (these sts are for the armhole steeks and are not knit into the pattern). When the work measures 37-42-46 (46-48) cm , bind off the center 28-28-30 (30-32) sts (+ 5 center steek sts) for the neck in the front and knit the rest back and forth on the needle. Then bind off for the neck every other row: 2 sts 1 time, dec 1 st 2 times. At the same time, when the work measures 41-46-50 (50-52) cm , bind off the center 34-34-36 (36-38) sts in the back for the neck. Then dec 1 st at each neck edge on the next row. Bind off when the work measures 43-48-52 (52-54) cm  (adjust for complete pattern). 

Sleeves: Cast on 36-38-40 (42-44) sts on smaller double pointed needles with natural and knit 3 cm  seed st. Change to larger double pointed needles; join and place a marker at the join. Change to stockinette st and increase 4-2-4 (6-6) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40-44 (48-50) sts. Knit pattern as on the body (centering the pattern on the sleeve). At the same time, after the seed st, increase 1 st each side of marker 18-20-22 (22-24) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6: alternately every 2nd and 3rd row
Size 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: alternately every 3rd and 4th row 
= 76-80-88 (92-96) sts. When the work measures 24-28-31 (35-38) cm , knit 2 cm  reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body, bind off all sts.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the center of the increased sts for armholes and at the center of the front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 st from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 st from first seam. Cut up for armholes and at the center front. Sew shoulder seams. 
Pick up approx. 70-90 sts along the left front on smaller circular needles and knit Border back and forth on the needle. Repeat along the right front, but after 1 cm  make 4-4-5 (5-5) buttonholes evenly distributed on the buttonband - 1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and increase 2 new sts on the next row (remember to make corresponding buttonholes on the folding edge). 

Pick up approx. 80-90 sts around the neck on smaller circular needles with natural and knit 3 cm  seed st back and forth on the needle, bind off all sts. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. 
Fold the edges (Borders) over against the wrong side and sew. 
Turn the cardigan inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cutting-edge on the body by hand.
