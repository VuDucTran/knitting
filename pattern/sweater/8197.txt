DECREASE TIP:
To work out how to decrease evenly, count the number of stitches to be decreased over (e.g. 25 stitches) and divide by the number of decreases to be made (e.g. 5) = 5. In this example, knit every 4th and 5th stitch together.

PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 and A.2. Choose diagram for your size. The diagrams show all the rows in the pattern seen from the right side.

INCREASE TIP (for mid under sleeve):
Start 1 stitch after the marker thread, make 1 yarn over, work until there is 1 stitch left on the round, make 1 yarn over and knit 1 (= 2 stitches increased). On the next round knit the yarn overs twisted to prevent holes.
----------------------------------------------------------

JUMPER:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle as far as the armholes, then the front and back pieces are continued separately, back and forth on the needle. The sleeves are worked in the round with double pointed needles.

BODY:
Cast on 120-128-136-144-152-160 stitches with circular needle size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 4 cm. Change to circular needle size 5.5 mm. Insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round (= in the side). The next round is worked as follows: Knit the first 21-23-25-25-27-29 stitches and, at the same time, decrease 4 stitches evenly over these stitches – read DECREASE TIP, work A.1 (choose diagram for your size = 19-19-19-23-23-23 stitches increased to 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches on the first round), knit 21-23-25-25-27-29 stitches and, at the same time, decrease 4 stitches evenly over these stitches, insert 1 marker thread (= in the side), knit the next 59-63-67-71-75-79 stitches and decrease 9-9-9-11-11-11 stitches evenly over these stitches. There are now 54-58-62-66-70-74 stitches between the marker threads on the front piece and 50-54-58-60-64-68 stitches on the back piece = a total of 104-112-120-126-134-142 stitches on the needle. The next round is worked as follows: 17-19-21-21-23-25 stitches stocking stitch, continue A.1 (= 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches) and work stocking stitch to end of round. Continue the pattern in this way. When A.1 has been completed, work A.2 over these 20-20-20-24-24-24 stitches. Repeat A.2 upwards. When the piece measures 23-26-29-32-35-38 cm cast off 6 stitches in each side for the armhole (cast off 3 stitches on each side of both marker threads). The front and back pieces are now finished separately.

BACK PIECE:
= 44-48-52-54-58-62 stitches. Work stocking stitch back and forth and cast off for the armholes at the beginning of each row in each side as follows: Cast off 2 stitches 1 time in each side and then 1 stitch 1-1-2-1-1-2 times in each side = 38-42-44-48-52-54 stitches. When the piece measures 34-38-42-46-50-54 cm cast off the middle 16-18-20-22-22-24 stitches for the neck and each shoulder is finished separately. Continue by casting off 1 stitch on next row from the neck = 10-11-11-12-14-14 stitches left on the shoulder. Continue working until the piece measures 36-40-44-48-52-56 cm and cast off. Work the other shoulder in the same way.

FRONT PIECE:
= 48-52-56-60-64-68 stitches. Continue with stocking stitch and A.2 and cast off for the armholes at the beginning of each row in each side as follows: Cast off 2 stitches 1 time in each side and then 1 stitch 1-1-2-1-1-2 times in each side = 42-46-48-54-58-60 stitches. Continue working stocking stitch and A.2 until the piece measures 31-34-38-41-45-48 cm. On the next row knit together the 10-10-10-12-12-12 stitches over the cable mid front, 2 and 2 (= 5-5-5-6-6-6 stitches decreased). On the next row, place the middle 9-11-13-14-14-16 stitches on 1 thread for the neck and each shoulder is finished separately. Continue to cast off for the neck at the beginning of each row from the neck as follows: Cast off 2 stitches 1 time and then 1 stitch 2-2-2-3-3-3 times = 10-11-11-12-14-14 stitches left on the shoulder. Continue working until the piece measures 36-40-44-48-52-56 cm and cast off. Work the other shoulder in the same way.

SLEEVE:
Cast on 32-32-34-34-36-36 stitches with double pointed needles size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 4 cm. Change to double pointed needles size 5.5 mm. Insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round (= mid under the sleeve). Knit 1 round where you decrease 4 stitches evenly on round in all sizes – read DECREASE TIP = 28-28-30-30-32-32 stitches. Continue to work stocking stitch in the round. When the piece measures 6 cm increase 2 stitches mid under the sleeve – read INCREASE TIP. Increase in this way every 3-3-4-3½-4½-3½ cm a total of 6-7-7-8-8-10 times = 40-42-44-46-48-52 stitches. When the piece measures 24-28-32-35-39-42 cm cast off 6 stitches mid under the sleeve (cast off 3 stitches on each side of the marker thread). Change to circular needle size 5.5 mm and work the sleeve cap back and forth in stocking stitch at the same time as you cast off at the beginning of each row in each side as follows: Cast off 2 stitches 1-2-2-2-2-3 times in each side and then 1 stitch 1 time in each side. Continue by casting off 2 stitches at the beginning of each row in each side until the piece measures 29-34-38-42-46-50 cm. Cast off 3 stitches at the beginning of the next 2 rows and then cast off the remaining stitches. The sleeve measures approx. 30-35-39-43-47-51 cm from the top down. Work another sleeve in the same way.

ASSEMBLY:
Sew the shoulder seams. Sew in the sleeves.

NECKLINE: 
Start mid back of neck and knit up from the right side approx. 40 to 62 stitches around the neck (including the stitches on the thread in front) with short circular needle size 4.5 mm. Knit 1 round where you increase evenly  to 54-64-66-70-70-76 stitches. Continue by working rib in the round (= knit 1 / purl 1) for 3 cm. Change to circular needle size 5.5 mm and cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
