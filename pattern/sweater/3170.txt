At the same time, when the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , dec 1 st at each side for armholes = 66-72 (78-84-90) sts. After Pattern 3 knit Pattern 2 over the center 22 sts, then knit 1-2 (3-3-3) rows with natural and knit the next row as follows (right side row): 3-5 (6-7-9) sts natural, Pattern 2, 16-18 (22-26-28) sts natural, Pattern 2, 3-5 (6-7-9) sts natural.

Change to larger double pointed needles and knit Pattern 1 (center the pattern on the sleeve), increasing 6-6 (8-10-10) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 34-34 (38-40-42) sts. Inc 1 st each side of marker 15-17 (18-17-20) times:
Size 3/4: alternately every 2nd and 3rd row 
Sizes 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: alternately every 3rd and every 4th row 
= 64-68 (74-74-82) sts - knit the increased sts into the pattern as you go along. 
When the work measures 20-23 (27-30-33) cm  (adjust for complete pattern), knit 2 rows stockinette st, then knit Pattern 2 with 7 sts stockinette st between repeats (center the pattern on the sleeve), and then knit the rest with stockinette st.
