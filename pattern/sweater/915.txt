When piece measures 26 (29-32) cm cast off for armholes in each side every 2nd row: 3 stitches x 1 (2-2), 2 stitches x 3 (3-4), 1 stitch x 2 (2-3) = 64 (68-74) stitches. Continue with Fur print until the stripe measures 11 (12-13) cm. Change back to Pelliza and needle size 3.5 mm at the same time as you increase 10 (10-12) stitches evenly on row = 74 (78-86) stitches. When piece measures 38 (44-47) cm place the middle 6 (6-8) stitches on a thread for hood. Continue to cast off for neck every 2nd row: 4 stitches x 1 (1-1), 3 stitches x 2 (2-2), 2 stitches x 1 (2-2), 1 stitch x 2 (1-1). Cast off when piece measures 43 (49-53) cm.
