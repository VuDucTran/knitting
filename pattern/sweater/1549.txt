Change to stockinette st and increase 24-28-36 (36-40) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row and also inc 5 sts at the center front (these sts are for the steek and are not knit into the pattern) = 184-198-216 (226-240) sts (+ 5 steek sts). Knit Pattern 1 (refer to chart in Små Drops No. 6). At the same time, when the work measures 26-28-31 (32-33) cm , knit the next row as follows: 46-50-54 (57-60) sts front, increase 5 sts, 92-98-108 (112-120) sts back, increase 5 sts, 46-50-54 (57-60) sts front (the increased sts on each side are for the armhole steeks and are not knit into the pattern). At the same time, when the work measures 26-28-31 (32-33) cm , bind off the center 28-30-30 (32-32) sts (+ 5 steek sts) in the front for the neck and knit the rest back and forth on needle. Then bind off on each neck edge every other row 2 sts 2 times, dec 1 st 3 times. At the same time, when the work measures 42-45-50 (52-54) cm , knit Pattern 2.

Change to larger double pointed needles, knit Pattern 1 (centering the pattern on the sleeve) and increase 10-8-10 (14-12) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 46-46-50 (56-56) sts. At the same time, after the rib, increase 1 st each side of marker 21-23-26 (25-27) times:
Size 3/4 years: alternately every 2nd and 3rd row
Sizes 5/6 + 7/8 years: every 3rd row

Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut up for armholes and at the center of the front. Sew shoulder seams. 
Pick up approx. 90-110 sts along the left front on smaller circular needles with natural and knit Border back and forth on the needles, bind off all sts. Repeat along the right front, but after 1 cm  make 5-5-6 (6-6) buttonholes evenly distributed on the row - 1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on the next row (remember to make corresponding buttonholes on the folding edge). Fold the edges over against the wrong side and sew.
