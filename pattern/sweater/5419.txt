---------------------------------------------------------

BODY:
Worked back and forth on circular needle from mid front.  
Loosely cast on 152-166-180-194 sts (incl 5 band sts in each side) on circular needle size 4 mm with Muskat. Work first row as follows from RS: * K 10, K 2 tog *, repeat from *-* until 8-10-12-14 sts remain, K these sts = 140-153-166-179 sts. Then K 3 rows back and forth. Continue with diagram M.1 with 5 band sts in each side in garter st until finished measurements. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!
When piece measures approx. 16-18-18-19 cm (adjust so that 1 row remains of diagram M.1), work next row as follows (= WS): Work 34-37-41-44 sts, loosely cast off 7-7-6-6 sts for armhole, work 58-65-72-79 sts, loosely cast off 7-7-6-6 sts for armhole and work the rest of row (= 34-37-41-44 sts).
Put piece aside and knit the sleeves.

RIGHT SLEEVE:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 59-59-74-74 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm with Muskat. Work first round as follows: * K 6, K 2 tog *, repeat from *-* until 3-3-2-2 sts remain, K these sts = 52-52-65-65 sts. Then P 1 round, K 1 round and P 1 round. Insert a marker at the beg of the round. Continue with diagram M.1 - beg in the 11th-1st-4th-7th sts in diagram, count from the right (in size 3/4 and 8/10 years, K first st, and at the end of round K this st tog with the last st on round). Continue working like this until piece measures approx. 3-4-4-5 cm (adjust so that 1 round of diagram M.1 remains). On next round cast off the FIRST 6-6-7-7 sts, work the rest of round = 46-46-58-58 sts. 

LEFT SLEEVE:
Cast on and work as right sleeve but when piece measures 3-4-4-5 cm, cast off like this:
Size 3/4 and 8/10: cast off the FIRST 6-7 sts on round
Size 5/7 and 11/12: cast off the LAST 6-7 sts on round
(this is important to make the pattern correct on yoke).

YOKE:
Slip sleeves on to same circular needle as body where armholes were cast off = 218-231-270-283 sts. NOTE: It is very important that the right sleeve is inserted in the right side and the left sleeve is inserted in the left side so that the pattern fits onwards. 
Continue with diagram M.2 – start at the arrow for the correct size - with 5 band sts in garter st in each side (= 16-17-20-21 repetitions on the round). 
AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 18-20-21-23 cm, cast off for BUTTON HOLES - see explanation above.
When diagram M.2 has been worked vertically, 90-95-110-115 sts remain on needle. Work next row as follows from RS: K 5 (while at the same time casting off for the last button hole), * K 2 tog, K 1 *, repeat from *-* until 7-6-6-5 sts remain, K these sts = 64-67-77-80 sts. K 3-3-5-5 rows back and forth, then cast off with K from RS.

Sew tog the openings under the sleeves and sew on buttons.
