Materials: Eskimo
50-50-100 g colour no. 12, Light blue

DROPS circular needle size 10 mm

Knitting tension: 9 sts x 12 rows with 1 thread of each quality on needles size 10 mm in stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm.
Garter sts (back and forth on row): Knit all rows.

The hat is knitted back and forth on circular needles because of the knitting technique used for the top, beginning at the centre back. Cast on 38-42-46 sts with 1 thread of Eskimo and 1 thread of Camelia (Alpaca) on circular needle size 10 mm. Knit 6 rows of garter sts, and continue in stocking sts. When the piece measures 12-14-16 cm bind off on every other row as follows: 6 sts 4 times and then on every row 5-7-9 sts 2 times = 4 sts left on row. The piece measures approx. 19-21-23 cm. Now knit the top as follows from the right side: Knit a row, *push sts to the right side of needle without turning, tighten the thread at the back side and knit another row from the right side*. Repeat from *-*. This way a round top is created in stocking sts without having to purl from the wrong side. Knit until the top measures approx 6-10 cm, cut the thread and pull through sts, pull tight and sew the thread tight. Sew the hat at the centre back in the outermost part of the outermost st to avoid a chunky seam.

Pompoms: Make 2 small pompoms in Camelia (now Alpaca) with a diameter of approx. 4 cm. Attach the pompoms to the top of the hat, one each side at the top of the garter sts edge.
