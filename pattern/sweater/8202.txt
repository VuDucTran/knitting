Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comINFORMATION FOR PATTERN:

PATTERN: 
Jumper: See diagrams A.1 to A.6. Choose diagram for your size.
Hat: See diagram A.7.
Work the entire pattern in stocking stitch.

DECREASE/INCREASE TIP:
To calculate how to decrease or increase evenly, use the total number of stitches on round (e.g. 84 stitches) and divide stitches by number of decreased/increases to be done (e.g. 6) = 14. 
I.e. in this example knit approx. every 13th and 14th stitch together when decreasing.
When increasing make 1 yarn over after every 14th stitch. On next round knit yarn over twisted to avoid holes.

ELEVATION:
Insert 1 marker at beginning of round = mid back. Begin from right side with north sea and knit as before until 7-7-8-8-9-9 stitches have been worked past marker, turn, tighten yarn and purl 14-14-16-16-18-18. Turn, tighten yarn and knit 21-21-24-24-27-27, turn, tighten yarn and purl 28-28-32-32-36-36. Turn, tighten yarn and knit 35-35-40-40-45-45, turn, tighten yarn and purl 42-42-48-48-54-54. Turn piece, tighten yarn and knit until mid back.

KNITTING TIP-1:
To avoid the knitting tension to tighten when working pattern, it is important not to tighten the strands on back side of piece. Switch to a higher needle number when working pattern if the pattern is somewhat tight.

KNITTING TIP-2 (applies to yoke on jumper):
If knitting tension is incorrect in height and there are more rows vertically on 10 cm than stated in pattern the round yoke will be too short and the armholes too small. To avoid this work 1 extra round in stocking stitch evenly in the unicoloured sections on yoke.

DECREASE TIP-1 (applies to mid under sleeve):
Begin 2 stitches before marker thread and knit 2 together, marker thread, slip 1 stitch knitwise, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over stitch worked (= 2 stitches decreased).

DECREASE TIP-2 (applies to hat):
Decrease as follows after marker: Slip 1 stitch knitwise, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over stitch worked (= 1 stitch decreased).
----------------------------------------------------------

JUMPER:
Worked in the round on circular needle, top down. Work sleeves in the round on double pointed needles. Rounds begin mid back.

NECK EDGE:
Cast on 84-88-88-96-96-100 stitches on a short circular needle size 3.5 mm with north sea. Knit 1 round. Then work rib in the round (= knit 2/purl 2) for 3 cm. Knit 1 round while decreasing 6-4-4-6-6-4 stitches evenly - read DECREASE/INCREASE TIP = 78-84-84-90-90-96 stitches. Then work yoke 
as explained below. 

YOKE:
Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work ELEVATION at the back of neck - see explanation above. When elevation has been worked, finish by knitting 0-0-2-3-0-2 rounds with north sea. Read KNITTING TIP-1 AND KNITTING TIP-2!
Then work A.1 in the round (= 13-14-14-15-15-16 repetitions of 6 stitches). Continue pattern and increase as shown in diagram. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! On round marked with arrow-1 in A.1 there are 117-126-126-135-135-144 stitches on needle. Work round as shown in diagram and increase AT THE SAME TIME 18 stitches evenly in all sizes - remember DECREASE/INCREASE TIP = 135-144-144-153-153-162 stitches. Work A.1 (there is now room for 15-16-16-17-17-18 repetitions of 9 stitches). On round marked with arrow-2 in A.1 increase 21-24-24-27-27-30 stitches evenly = 156-168-168-180-180-192 stitches. When A.1 has been worked, work A.2 in the round (= 13-14-14-15-15-16 repetitions of 12 stitches). Continue A.2 and increase as shown in diagram. On round marked with arrow-3 in A.2 there are 208-224-224-240-240-256 stitches. Work round as shown in diagram and increase at the same time 4-0-12-0-12-8 stitches evenly on this round = 212-224-236-240-252-264 stitches.
When A.2 has been worked, work A.3 in the round (= 53-56-59-60-63-66 repetitions of 4 stitches). After A.3 piece measures approx. 17-17-18-19-20-21 cm from cast-on edge mid front. Work next round as follows with light beige: work 31-33-35-36-38-40 stitches in stocking stitch (= ½ back piece), slip the next 45-47-49-49-51-53 stitches on 1 stitch holder for sleeve, cast on 6-6-6-8-8-8 new stitches on needle (= in the side under sleeve), work 61-65-69-71-75-79 stitches in stocking stitch (= front piece), slip the next 45-47-49-49-51-53 stitches on 1 stitch holder for sleeve, cast on 6-6-6-8-8-8 new stitches on needle (= in the side under sleeve) and work the remaining 30-32-34-35-37-39 stitches in stocking stitch (= ½ back piece).
Cut the strand. Finish body and sleeves separately. NOW MEASURE PIECE FROM HERE!  

BODY:
= 134-142-150-158-166-174 stitches. Begin in one side of piece, in the middle of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches cast on under sleeve. Work A.4 in the round and increase at the same time 2 stitches evenly on first round = 136-144-152-160-168-176 stitches on needle and 17-18-19-20-21-22 repetitions of 8 stitches. 
When A.4 has been worked, work A.5 in the round (= 17-18-19-20-21-22 repetitions of 8 stitches). Repeat A.5 until piece measures approx. 13-17-20-23-26-29 cm from division – adjust so that 2-4 rounds have been worked after a round with dots. Work A.6 in the round (= 34-36-38-40-42-44 repetitions of 4 stitches). When A.6 has been worked, piece measures approx. 17-21-24-27-30-33 cm from division. Knit 1 round while increasing 24-28-28-32-32-32 stitches evenly = 160-172-180-192-200-208 stitches. Switch to circular needle size 3.5 mm. Work rib in the round = knit 2/purl 2 for 4 cm. Cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl but to avoid at tight cast-off edge make 1 yarn over after every 4th stitch AT THE SAME TIME cast off (cast off yarn overs as stitches). Jumper measures approx. 38-42-46-50-54-58 cm from shoulder and down.

SLEEVE:
Slip the 45-47-49-49-51-53 stitches from stitch holder in one side of piece on double pointed needles size 4 mm and pick in addition up 1 new stitch in each of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches cast on under sleeve = 51-53-55-57-59-61 stitches on needle. Insert a marker thread in the middle of the 6-6-6-8-8-8 stitches under sleeve and 1 marker thread in the middle stitch on round (= mid on top of sleeve. Read the rest of sleeve before continuing!
Begin at marker thread mid under sleeve and work A.4 in the round but note that the pattern will not fit an entire repetition mid under sleeve. Begin with 3rd-2nd-1st-8th-7th-6th stitch in A.4 and repeat A.4 in the round as long as you can. Pattern will be symmetrical mid under sleeve and stitch with marker thread mid on top of sleeve should now fit 4th stitch in A.4. 
When A.4 has been worked, work A.5 in the round but adjust so that A.5 fits nicely over A.4 (stitch with marker thread should fit placement of a dot). Repeat A.5 onwards. 
AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 2 cm, decrease 2 stitches mid under sleeve - read DECREASE TIP-1. Decrease like this every 3-3-5-5-7-6 cm 5-6-5-6-5-6 times in total = 41-41-45-45-49-49 stitches.
When piece measures approx. 12-16-20-24-28-31 cm from division – adjust so that 2-4 round with forest green have been worked after a round with dots, work A.6 in the round – begin round so that pattern fits nicely over dots in A.5. When A.6 has been worked, switch to double pointed needles size 3.5 mm. Knit 1 round with forest green while decreasing 1 stitch evenly in all sizes = 40-40-44-44-48-48 stitches. Work rib in the round = knit 2/purl 2 for 4 cm. Cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl but to avoid at tight cast-off edge make 1 yarn over after every 4th stitch AT THE SAME TIME cast off. Sleeve measures approx. 20-24-28-32-36-39 cm from division under sleeve. Work the other sleeve the same way.
----------------------------------------------------------

HAT:
Worked in the round on circular needle, switch to double pointed needles when needed. Cast on 104-112-112-120 stitches on circular needle size 2.5 mm with forest green. Knit 1 round. Then work rib (= knit 2/purl 2) for 3 cm. Switch to circular needle size 3 mm. Knit 1 round while decreasing 8 stitches evenly in all sizes - read DECREASE/INCREASE TIP = 96-104-104-112 stitches. Work A.7 in the round (= 12-13-13-14 repetitions of 8 stitches). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When A.7 has been worked, work in stocking stitch with light beige until finished measurements. When piece measures 15-16-17-17 cm, insert 8 markers in the piece, 12-13-13-14 stitches between each marker. On next round decrease after every marker - read DECREASE TIP-2 (= 8 stitches decreased). Decrease like this on every other round a total of 6-7-7-8 times = 48 stitches remain on needles in all sizes.
* Knit 1 round, on next round knit together all stitches 2 by 2* = 24 stitches. Repeat from *-* 1 more time = 12 stitches remain on needles. Cut the yarn and pull it through the remaining stitches, tighten together and fasten. Hat measures approx. 20-21-22-23 cm from top and down.
