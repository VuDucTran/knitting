Pattern: See chart (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is shown from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette stitch. The chart includes 4 patterns. The arrows indicate the starting points for different sizes.

Body: Knit the sweater in the round and cut steeks for armholes and neck split.
Cast on 176-184-200 (216-224-232) sts with coal gray on smaller circular needles; join and place a marker at the join. Knit rib for 5-5-5 (5-6-6) cm. Change to larger circular needles and knit Pattern 1. Place a second marker after 88-92-100 (108-112-116) sts for other side. After Pattern 1 repeat Pattern 2 until the work measures approximately 34-37-42 (44-46-49) cm adjust for complete pattern (approximately 11 cm of the work remains). Start Pattern 2 at the appropriate arrow on the chart and knit sts over front, start at the arrow again and knit sts over back. When the work measures 29-31-34 (35-36-38) cm, inc 4 sts at each side marker (these sts are for the steeks and are not knitted into the pattern). At the same time, when the work measures 32-35-37 (39-41-42) cm , bind off the center 6 sts in the front for a split. On the next row cast on 4 new sts over the bound-off sts - these sts are for the steek and are not knitted into the pattern. After Pattern 2 knit Pattern 3 - start at the appropriate arrow on the chart and knit sts over front, start at the arrow again and knit sts over back. When the work measures 40-43-47 (49-51-54) cm, bind off the center front 22-22-24 (24-26-26) sts + 4 steek sts for the neck. Knit the rest back and forth on needle. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 2 sts 1 time, 1 st 2 times. At the same time, when the work measures 43-46-51 (53-55-58) cm, bind off the center 32-32-34 (34-36-36) sts in the back for the neck. Then bind off 2 sts on either side on the next row for the neck in the back.
Bind off after Pattern 3 is complete - the work measures approximately 45-48-53 (55-57-60) cm.

Sleeves: Cast on 38-38-40 (42-44-46) sts on smaller double pointed needles with coal gray; join and place a marker at the join. Knit rib for 3-4-4 (4-4-4) cm, increasing 4-6-8 (6-6-4) sts evenly distributed on the last row = 42-44-48 (48-50-50) sts. Change to larger double pointed needles and knit Pattern 1. After the rib, inc 1 st each side of marker 14-16-18 (20-21-24) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8 + 9/10 + 13/14 years: alternately every 4th and every 5th row
Size 11/12 years: every 5th row
= 70-76-84 (88-92-98) sts. After Pattern 1 repeat Pattern 2 until the work measures approximately 23-27-31 (34-38-41) cm - adjust for complete pattern (approximately 3 cm of the work remains). After Pattern 2 knit Pattern 4, then 2 rows coal gray. The work measures approximately 26-30-34 (37-41-43) cm. Then knit 2 cm reverse stockinette stitch for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body. Bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at the center front in the split. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and split. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 20-30 sts along the left side of the split on smaller needle with coal gray and knit border. Repeat along the right side of the split. Fold the edges over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the split together at the bottom. Pick up approximately 80-94 sts around the neck and over the split on smaller double pointed needles with coal gray and knit border back and forth on needle. Fold the edge over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand. Sew on the hooks.
