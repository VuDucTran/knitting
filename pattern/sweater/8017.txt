INCREASE TIP (for mid under the sleeve):
Start 1 stitch before the marker thread, make 1 yarn over, knit 2 (the marker thread sits between these 2 stitches), make 1 yarn over (= 2 stitches increased). On the next round knit the yarn overs twisted to prevent holes.

BUTTONHOLES:
Decrease for the buttonholes on the right band (when the garment is worn). 1 buttonhole = start from the right side, knit 1, knit 2 together and make 1 yarn over. On the next row knit the yarn overs so that there are holes.
Decrease for the buttonholes when the piece measures:
1/3 months: 4, 9, 14 and 19 cm.

DECREASE TIP (for the neckline):
Decrease for the v-neck on the inside of the 5 band stitches in garter stitch towards mid front. All decreases are worked from the right side!
Decrease as follows after the 5 band stitches: Slip 1 stitch as if to knit, knit 1, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch (= 1 stitch decreased).
Decrease as follows before the 5 band stitches: Work until there are 7 stitches left on the needle, knit 2 together and work the 5 band stitches in garter stitches  (= 1 stitch decreased).
----------------------------------------------------------

JACKET:
Front and back pieces are worked back and forth with circular needle in separate sections. The sleeves are worked in the round with double pointed needles.

BACK PIECE:
Cast on 51-55-59 (65-69-73) stitches with circular needle size 3 mm and Cotton Merino. Work 2 RIDGES back and forth – see description above. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and work the next row as follows from the right side: 3 edge stitches in garter stitch, 13-15-17 (18-20-22) stitches stocking stitch, A.1 (= 19-19-19 (23-23-23) stitches), 13-15-17 (18-20-22) stitches stocking stitch and 3 edge stitches in garter stitch. Continue the pattern in this way. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When the piece measures 18-19-21 (23-26-29) cm work 2 ridges over the outermost 6 stitches in each side (the other stitches are worked as before). When you have worked 2 ridges in each side, cast off 3 stitches at the beginning of the next 2 rows for the armholes = 45-49-53 (59-63-67) stitches on the needle. The next row is worked as follows from the right side: 3 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the armhole, 10-12-14 (15-17-19) stitches stocking stitch, continue with A.1 over the next 19-19-19 (23-23-23) stitches, 10-12-14 (15-17-19) stitches stocking stitch and 3 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the armhole. Continue the pattern in this way. When the piece measures 26-28-31 (34-38-42) cm cast off the middle 13-13-13 (17-17-17) stitches for the neck and each shoulder is finished separately. Continue by casting off 1 stitch on the next row from the neck = 15-17-19 (20-22-24) stitches left on the shoulder. Continue working until there is 1 row left before the piece measures 28-30-33 (36-40-44) cm – adjust so that the next row is worked from the wrong side. Knit 1 row from the wrong side and loosely cast off in knit from the right side! Work the other shoulder in the same way.

RIGHT FRONT PIECE:
Cast on 30-32-34 (37-39-41) stitches with circular needle size 3 mm (including 5 band stitches towards mid front). Work 2 ridges. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and work the next row as follows from the right side: 5 band stitches in garter stitch, A.2 (= 9-9-9 (11-11-11) stitches), 13-15-17 (18-20-22) stitches stocking stitch and 3 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the side. Continue the pattern in this way – remember BUTTONHOLES on the band – see description above. When the piece measures 18-19-21 (23-26-29) cm, work 2 ridges over the outermost 6 stitches towards the side (the other stitches are worked as before). When you have worked 2 ridges in the side cast off 3 stitches at the beginning of the next row from the side for the armhole = 27-29-31 (34-36-38) stitches. The next row is worked as follows from the right side: 5 band stitches in garter stitch, continue with A.2 over the next 9-9-9 (11-11-11) stitches, 10-12-14 (15-17-19) stitches stocking stitch and 3 edge stitches in garter stitch towards the armhole. Continue the pattern in this way. AT THE SAME TIME when you have worked 1 row from the wrong side after the last buttonhole (the piece measures approx. 20-21-24 (26-30-34) cm), knit the 5 band stitches, turn the piece, tighten the strand and knit back over the 5 band stitches (in other words, the other stitches on the needle are not worked). Then work as before across all the stitches again (this is done to insure that the band lies neatly around the neck). AT THE SAME TIME on the next row from the right side, begin decreasing for the v-neck. Decrease 1 stitch on the inside of the 5 band stitches in garter stitch – READ DECREASE TIP. Decrease in this way every 4th row (i.e. every other row from the right side) a total of 4 times in all sizes, then on every  2nd row (i.e. on every row from the right side) a total of 3-3-3 (5-5-5) times = 20-22-24 (25-27-29) stitches left on the shoulder. Continue working until there is 1 row left before the piece measures 28-30-33 (36-40-44) cm – adjust so that the next row is worked from the wrong side. Knit 1 row from the wrong side, turn the piece, knit the 5 band stitches and cast off the remaining 15-17-19 (20-22-24) stitches on the shoulder. Cut the strand.

NECKLINE: 
Work garter stitch back and forth over the 5 band stitches for the neckline until the it measures approx. 5-5-5 (6-6-6) cm from the shoulder, cast off.

LEFT FRONT PIECE:
Work as for the right, but reversed. In other words, work A.3 instead of A.2 (do not decrease for buttonholes on the left band). On the first row from the wrong side when the piece measures 20-21-24 (26-30-34) cm) knit the 5 band stitches, turn the piece, tighten the strand and knit back over the 5 band stitches (i.e. the other stitches on the needle are not worked). Then work as before over all the stitches again (this is done to insure that the band will lie neatly around the neck). AT THE SAME TIME on the next row from the right side begin decreasing for the v-neck – READ DECREASE TIP. Continue working until there is one row left before finished length – adjust so that the next row is worked from the wrong side. Knit 1 row from the wrong side, turn the piece, cast off the first 15-17-19(20-22-24) stitches and knit the 5 band stitches. Continue working garter stitch back and forth over the 5 band stitches until the neckline measures 5-5-5 (6-6-6) cm from the shoulder, cast off.

SLEEVE:
Cast on 32-32-34 (36-38-38) stitches with double pointed needles size 3 mm. Work 2 RIDGES in the round – see description above. Change to double pointed needles size 4 mm and work stocking stitch. When the piece measures 4-4-5 (6-7-8) cm insert 1 marker thread at the beginning of the round (= mid under the sleeve). On the next round increase 2 stitches mid under the sleeve – READ INCREASE TIP. Increase in this way every 5½-3½-3 (3-3-3) cm a total of 3-5-6 (7-8-10) times = 38-42-46 (50-54-58) stitches. When the piece measures 18-20-23 (27-31-35) cm divide the piece mid under the sleeve. Insert 1 marker, work 3 rows stocking stitch back and forth over all the stitches and loosely cast off.

ASSEMBLY:
Sew the shoulder seams inside the cast-off edge. Sew together the neckline mid back - the seam turns in towards the wrong side. Sew the neckline to the neck edge at the back of the neck. Sew the side seams edge to edge in the outermost loop of the outermost stitch from the armhole and down, but stop when there is still approx. 6 cm at the bottom in each side (= split).
Sew in the sleeves – the marker mid under the sleeve should fit to the side of the body. 
Sew the buttons on to the left band. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
