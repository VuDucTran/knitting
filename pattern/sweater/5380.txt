When piece measures 32-34-37-39-42 cm, work all the sts in stocking st in garter st until finished measurements, work the remaining sts as before. When piece measures 36-39-41-44-46 cm, slip the outermost 13-14-16-17-18 sts on a stitch holder for neck. Then cast off at beg of every row from neck: 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 3 times = 16-17-18-18-19 sts remain on shoulder. Cast off when piece measures 40-43-46-49-52 cm.
