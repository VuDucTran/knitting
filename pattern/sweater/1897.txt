At the same time, when 8 decreases of the raglan shaping remain put the center 7-9 (5-7-9-9) sts on a stitch holder for the neck. Then put sts on a stitch holder for the neck every other row: 2 sts 3 times. After the last binding off put the remaining sts on the front on the stitch holder = 29-31 (27-29-31-31) sts. The work measures approx. 57-61 (64-67-69-72) cm .

When the work measures 45-45 (49-50-50-51) cm , bind off 4 sts on each side. Continue to knit the edge sts on each side in garter st along the raglan shaping (for seam).
