YOKE: 
Cast on 92-92-96-96-96-96 sts on a short circular needle size 3 mm with dark brown, insert 1 marker at beg of round (= mid back). K 1 round. Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 3 cm. 
Then work an elevation in back of neck as follows (continue in rib): Work 8 sts past marker, turn, tighten yarn and work 16 sts back, turn, tighten yarn and work 24 sts, turn, continue by working 8 sts more on every turn until a total of 48-48-64-64-64-64 sts have been worked, turn and work 1 round until marker mid back again.
Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work 1 round in stocking st while at the same time inc 10 sts evenly = 102-102-106-106-106-106 sts. 

Now insert 4 new markers (for raglan) as follows: Work 17-17-18-18-18-18 sts from marker mid back, insert 1st marker here (at the same time remove marker mid back), work 17 sts more (= sleeve), insert 2nd marker, work 34-34-36-36-36-36 sts (= front piece) and insert 3rd marker, work 17 sts (= sleeve), insert 4th marker and work until 1st marker again (there are 34-34-36-36-36-36 sts between markers on back piece). REMEMBER STRIPES! Then on 1st round, inc 1 st on each side of the 4 markers for raglan (= 8 inc) - SEE INCREASE TIP! Repeat inc every round 1-3-3-5-5-7 times (= 2-4-4-6-6-8 times in total) and then every other round 13-13-15-15-17-17 times = 222-238-258-274-290-306 sts on needle. Work next round as follows: Slip the 47-51-55-59-63-67 sts between 1st and 2nd marker on a stitch holder, cast on 8 new sts over stitch holder, work until 3rd marker, slip the 47-51-55-59-63-67 sts between 3rd and 4th marker on a stitch holder, cast on 8 new sts over stitch holder, work until 1st marker again = 144-152-164-172-180-188 sts on needle.
