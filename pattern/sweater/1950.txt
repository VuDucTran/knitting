Pattern: See charts (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is shown from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette stitch.
All charts have arrows indicating the starting points for different sizes.

Border: Knit 3 cm stockinette stitch, purl 1 row (for the folding edge), 3 cm stockinette stitch.

Body: Knit the cardigan in the round after the border and cut steeks for armholes and at the center front.
Cast on 179-195-211 (219-227-243) sts (including 2 edge sts) on 3,5 circular needles with wine red and knit 2-2-3 (3-3-3) cm stockinette stitch back and forth on the needles, purl 1 row (for the folding edge - measure the work from here), 2-2-3 (3-3-3) cm stockinette stitch. Cast on 3 sts at the center front - these sts + edge sts (= 5 sts) are for the center front steek and are not knitted into the pattern. Join and start Pattern 1 at the appropriate arrow on the chart after the 5 steek sts at the center front. After Pattern 1 repeat Pattern 2 (start at the appropriate arrow on the chart after the 5 center front steek sts) until the work measures approximately 25-28-33 (35-37-40) cm - adjust for complete pattern (approximately 20 cm of the work remains). Then repeat Pattern 3 to finished dimensions (start at the appropriate arrow on the chart after the 5 steek sts at the center front).
At the same time (for some sizes this will be while knitting Pattern 2, for others Pattern 3!), when the work measures 26-28-31 (32-33-36) cm, knit the next row as follows: 5 steek sts, 44-48-52 (54-56-60) sts for the front, inc 4 sts (for the armhole steek, not knitted into the pattern), 89-97-105 (109-113-121) sts for the back, inc 4 sts (armhole steek), 44-48-52 (54-56-60) sts for the front. When the work measures 41-44-48 (50-52-55) cm , bind off the center 18-18-20 (20-22-22) sts + 5 steek sts for the neck. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 3 sts 1 time, 2 sts 2 times, 1 st 1 time. At the same time, when the work measures 43-46-51 (53-55-58) cm , bind off the center back 31-31-33 (33-35-35) sts for the neck. Then bind off 2 sts at each back neck edge on the next row. Bind off after Pattern 3 is complete, the work measures approximately 45-48-53 (55-57-60) cm [17.75" - 18-7/8" - 20-7/8" (21-5/8" - 22.5" - 23-5/8")}.

Sleeves: Cast on 40-42-46 (46-48-50) sts on 3,5 mm double pointed needles with wine red; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 2-2-3 (3-3-3) cm  stockinette, purl 1 row (for the folding edge - measure the work from here), 2-2-3 (3-3-3) cm stockinette stitch, increasing 4-6-6 (6-8-6) sts evenly distributed on the last row = 44-48-52 (52-56-56) sts. Knit Pattern 1. After the border, inc 1 st each side of marker: 20-20-23 (25-25-25) times:
Size 3/4 years: alternately every 2nd and 3rd row
Sizes 5/6 + 7/8 + 9/10 years: every 3rd row
Sizes 11/12 + 13/14 years: alternately every 3rd and 4th row
= 84-88-98 (102-106-106) sts. After Pattern 1 repeat Pattern 2 until the work measures approximately 15-18-22 (25-29-31) cm - adjust for complete pattern. Then knit Pattern 4 to finished dimensions. When the work measures 21-24-28 (31-35-37) cm, put 2 sts each side of marker on a stitch holder. Continue to knit back and forth on needle and at the same time put sts on a stitch holder on either side for sleeve caps every other row: 6-7-7 (8-8-8) sts 4 times. The work now measures approximately 24-27-31 (34-38-40) cm. Put all sts back on the same needles again and knit in the round over all sts as follows: 2 cm reverse stockinette stitch with wine red for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body, bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at center front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and at the center front. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 84-90-100 (104-108-114) sts along the left front on 3.5 mm circular needle with wine red and knit border (see instructions above), bind off. Fold the edges over the cutting edge and sew. Repeat along the right front, but after 1 cm make 5-6-6 (6-6-7) buttonholes evenly distributed on the row (1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on the next row). Remember to make corresponding buttonholes on the folding edge. Pick up approximately 88-110 sts around the neck on smaller circular needles with wine red and knit border as follows: 3 cm stockinette stitch, change to natural and knit 1 row stockinette stitch, purl 1 row (for the folding edge), change back to wine red and knit 3 cm stockinette stitch, bind off. Fold the edge over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand. Fold all edges over against the wrong side and sew. Sew on the buttons.
