Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at the center front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and at the center front. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 90-130 sts along the left front on smaller needles with red and knit border, bind off. Fold the edge over against the cut edge on the body and sew. Repeat along the right front, but after 1 cm make 6-6-6 (7-7-7) buttonholes evenly distributed on the row (1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on the next row). Remember to make corresponding buttonholes on the folding edge. Pick up approximately 96-110 sts around the neck on smaller needles with red and knit border as follows: 2.5 cm stockinette stitch, change to coal gray and knit 1 row stockinette stitch, purl 1 row (for the folding edge), change back to red and knit 2.5 cm stockinette stitch, bind off. Fold the edge over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand. Sew on the buttons.  Have you made this or any other of our designs?
