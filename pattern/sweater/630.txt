Bind off and fold the edge over double against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a stitch in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand.
