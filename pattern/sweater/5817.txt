BODY:
Worked in the round on circular needle. 
Cast on 143-163-171-185-205 sts on circular needle size 3.5 mm with Merino Extra Fine. K 1 round. Then work next round as follows: * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* over the first 20-24-28-28-32 sts, work diagram A.1 (= 29-29-29-35-35 sts), * K 2, P 2 *, repeat from *-* over the remaining 94-110-114-122-138 sts. Continue rib like this until A.1 has been work 1 time vertically. Rib measures approx. 5 cm and there are 149-169-177-193-213 sts on needle (i.e. the 29-29-29-35-35 sts in A.1 are inc to 35-35-35-43-43). Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and work 1 round in stocking st while AT THE SAME TIME dec 21-25-25-27-31 sts evenly = 128-144-152-166-182 sts - NOTE: Do not dec over the 35-35-35-43-43 sts from A.1, work these sts K over K and P over P. Now insert a marker at beg of round and a marker after 67-75-79-87-95 sts (these marks the sides) - NOTE: Adjust the markers so that A.1 is in the middle of front piece. There are now 67-75-79-87-95 sts on front piece and 61-69-73-79-87 sts on back piece. 
Work next round as follows: Work diagram A.3 over the first 16-20-22-22-26 sts, diagram A.2 over the next 35-35-35-43-43 sts and diagram A.3 over the remaining 77-89-95-101-113 sts. Continue the pattern like this. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 8 cm, inc 1 st on each side of both markers. Repeat inc every 6-6-8-8-8 cm 2 more times = 140-156-164-178-194 sts – work the inc sts in pattern. When piece measures 27-29-32-33-34 cm, cast off 6 sts in each side for armholes (i.e. 3 sts on each side of both markers) and finish front and back piece separately.

BACK PIECE:
= 61-69-73-79-87 sts. Continue pattern as before until finished measurements. AT THE SAME TIME cast off at beg of every row in each side as follows: Cast off 2 sts 1-1-1-2-3 times and 1 st 1-3-3-2-2 times = 55-59-63-67-71 sts. When piece measures 38-41-45-47-49 cm, cast off the middle 15-15-15-19-19 sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Continue to cast off 1 st on next row from neck = 19-21-23-23-25 sts remain on the shoulder. Continue until piece measures 40-43-47-49-51 cm and cast off.

FRONT PIECE:
= 67-75-79-87-95 sts. Continue pattern as before while AT THE SAME TIME casting off for armholes at beg of every row in each side as on back piece. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures approx. 28-30-33-34-35 cm – adjust so that at least 1 or 3 rows in stocking st have been worked after a row with cables, work A.4 from RS, instead of A.2 (work the other sts as before), i.e. dec 6-6-6-8-8 sts in A.4. On next row, cast off the middle 17-17-17-21-21 sts for neck and finish each part separately. After all cast offs, 19-21-23-23-25 sts remain on shoulder. Continue to work until piece measures 40-43-47-49-51 cm up to shoulder and cast off. Repeat on the other side of neck.

SLEEVE:
Cast on 48-48-52-52-56 sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm. K 1 round. Then work rib (= K 2/P 2). When rib measures 5 cm, dec 8-6-8-6-8 sts evenly = 40-42-44-46-48 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 4 mm and work diagram A.3. When piece measures 7-7-7-7-8 cm, insert a marker at the beg of round. Now inc 2 sts mid under sleeve (i.e. 1 st on each side of marker). Repeat inc every 4½-4½-4½-4-4 cm, 4-5-6-8-9 more times = 50-54-58-64-68 sts – work the inc sts in pattern. When piece measures 28-32-36-41-46 cm, cast off 6 sts mid under sleeve (i.e. cast off 3 sts on each side of marker) and work the sleeve back and forth on needle until finished measurements. Cast off for sleeve cap at beg of every row in each side as follows: 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 2-3-4-4-5 times. Then cast off 2 sts at beg of every row in each side until piece measures 32-37-41-46-52 cm, then cast off 3 sts at beg of the next 2 rows. Cast off the remaining sts, piece measures approx. 33-38-42-47-53 cm.
