KNITTING TIP: 
If your knitting tension is too tight, the raglan will be too short and the armhole too small. You may compensate for this by working 1 extra round without dec with regular intervals in between rounds with dec.  

DECREASING TIP (applies to raglan):
Make all dec from RS. 
Before marker: K2 tog

JACKET: 
Worked back and forth on circular needle. 
Cast on 138-146-150-158 sts (includes 12 front band sts each side towards mid front) on circular needle size 4 mm with Silke-Alpaca. Work 6 rows garter st – see above. Insert 2 markers in piece, 37-39-40-42 sts in from each side (back piece = 64-68-70-74 sts). Change to circular needle size 4.5 mm and continue in stocking st with 12 garter sts each side (= front bands). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 8 cm dec 1 st on each side of both markers and repeat the dec on every 9-9-10-10 cm a total of 3 times (= 4 dec per row) = 126-134-138-146 sts. Remember BUTTONHOLES on right front piece – see above.  When piece measures 31-32-33-34 cm cast off 8 sts each side for armhole (= 4 sts on each side of marker) = 110-118-122-130 sts. Put piece aside and knit the sleeves. 

SLEEVE:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. Cast on 46-50-52-56 sts on double pointed needles size 4 mm. Insert a marker at beg of round (= mid under arm). Work garter st – see above. When piece measures 8 cm cast off 4 sts on each side of marker = 38-42-44-48 sts. Put piece aside and knit the other sleeve

YOKE: 
SEE KNITTING TIP! Slip sleeves on the same circular needle size 4.5 mm as body piece where cast off for armholes = 186-202-210-226 sts. Insert a marker in all transitions between body piece and sleeves = 4 markers. Now dec for raglan – SEE DECREASING TIP! NOTE! Make the first 2 dec on body piece only and not on the sleeves. Dec on every 4th row 3-3-3-4 times and then on every other row 11-13-14-15 times. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 38-40-42-44 cm slip 6 sts each side on stitch holders for neck and cast off to shape the neckline at the beg of every row: 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 2 times. When all dec are complete there are 58-58-58-58 sts on row. Pick up 18-18-20-20 sts (incl sts on stitch holders) along neckline on each front piece = 94-94-98-98 sts. Work 10 rows garter st, AT THE SAME TIME dec 14-10-10-6 sts evenly on first row = 80-84-88-92 sts. Remember the last buttonhole! Cast off.
