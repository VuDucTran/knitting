Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comKnitting tension: Remember needle size is only a guide. 17 stitches x 22 rows with needle size 5 mm and stocking stitch = 10 x 10 cm.
Rib: * K2, P2 *, repeat from *-*.

Pattern: See diagram M.1 - NOTE: Each stripe is worked over 9 rows
Ridge/Garter stitch (back and forth on needle):
1 ridge = Knit 2 rows. 
Decrease tip (for raglan):
Decrease as follows in each transition between body and sleeves: From the right side (start 2 stitches before the marker thread): K2 together, (marker thread), slip 1 stitch as if to knit, K1, pass slipped stitch over.
From wrong side (start 2 stitches before marker thread):
P2 twisted together, (marker thread), P2 together.

Knitting tip: If your knitting tension is not correct in height and your work is too tight, the decreases for raglan will be too short and the armhole too small. This can be adjusted for by working 1 extra round without decreases regularly between decreases.
-------------------------------------------------------

Body: Cast on 124-128-144-152-164 stitches with circular needle size 4 mm and dark beige and knit 1 round. Then work rib until piece measures 4 cm. Insert 1 marker thread in each side. Change to circular needle size 5 mm and continue with stocking stitch according to M.1 to finished length - see description above. Remember the knitting tension!
Read the whole of the next section before continuing. 
Opening for insertion of crochet square: When piece measures 10-13-11-12-10 cm, knit 1 round but the 28-28-32-32-38 middle stitches on the front piece are purled. On the next round, cast off the middle 26-26-30-30-36 stitches on front piece (here you will insert the crochet square) = 98-102-114-122-128 stitches. Work stocking stitch back and forth on needle with 1 stitch in garter stitch in each side (= edge stitch for seam). When piece measures 25-28-29-30-31 cm cast on 26-26-30-30-36 new stitches mid front over the cast off stitches = 124-128-144-152-164 stitches. Continue working in the round at the same time as the middle 28-28-32-32-38 stitches in front are purled on the first round (the other stitches are continued in stocking stitch), then work stocking stitch over all stitches.
Armhole: When piece measures 27-30-31-32-33 cm cast off 6 stitches in each side for armholes (i.e. 3 stitches on each side of marker threads) = 56-58-66-70-76 stitches left on front and back pieces. Lay piece to one side and work sleeves.

Sleeve: Cast on 32-36-36-40-40 stitches with double pointed needles size 4 mm and dark beige and knit 1 round. Then work rib until piece measures 4 cm. Change to double pointed needles size 5 mm and continue with stocking stitch according to M.1(M.1 is worked up to where you place sleeves on same needle as body). When piece measures 6 cm increase 2 stitches mid under sleeve every 4.5-5-5-5-4.5 cm a total of 7-7-8-8-10 times = 46-50-52-56-60 stitches. When sleeve measures approx. 36-40-44-46-50 cm (adjust so that the stripe on the sleeve matches the stripe on the body. Avoid 1 wide stripe middle of sleeve) cast off 6 stitches mid under sleeve = 40-44-46-50-54 stitches. Lay piece to one side and work 1 more sleeve.

Yoke: Place sleeves on same circular needle as body, where you cast off stitches for armholes = 192-204-224-240-260 stitches. Insert 1 marker thread in all transitions between body and sleeves (= 4 marker threads).
Read the next 2 paragraphs before continuing.
Raglan: Read Knitting tip! Decrease 1 stitch on each side of all marker threads (= 8 decreases). Decrease every 2nd round - see Decrease tip: 1 stitch 15-15-16-16-16 times and then every round: 1 stitch 0-2-2-4-6 times.
Neckline: At the same time, when piece measures 37-39-41-43-45 cm place the middle 12-14-14-16-16 stitches on 1 thread for neck. Then decrease towards neck every 2nd row: 2 stitches 2-0-0-0-0 times and 1 stitch 2-6-6-6-6 times.
After all decreases to raglan and neck there are 48-42-54-52-56 stitches left on needle.
Neck: Knit up approx. 24 to 30 stitches (incl. stitches from thread) around the neck with medium pink and place all stitches on double pointed needles size 4 mm = approx. 66 to 86 stitches. Work 1 round stocking stitch at the same time as you adjust the number of stitches to 65-72-72-78-80 stitches. Work 5 rounds stocking stitch and loosely cast off - NOTE: So that the cast-off edge is not tight make a yarn over after approx. every 4th stitch at the same time as you cast off (yarn overs cast off as normal stitches).

Assembly: Sew openings under sleeves.

Crochet square:

Crochet tension: Remember hook size is only a guide.
1 crochet square with hook size 5 mm and 6 rounds measures approx. 18 x 18 cm.

Crochet info: The first treble crochet at the beginning of round is replaced by 3 chain stitches.

Stripe colours: Round 1 = peach, Round 2 = apricot, Round 3 = dark beige, Round 4 = light pink, Round 5 = medium pink, Round 6 = shocking pink. Begin at the beginning again after each round. NOTE: Work the strand end from each colour in at the same time as you work the next round; this avoids fastening so many strands at the end.

Crochet square: Read crochet info!
Work 4 chain stitches with hook size 5 mm and peach and form them into a ring with 1 slip stitch - see description of stripes above.
Round 1: * 3 treble crochets around ring, 2 chain stitches *, repeat from *-* a total of 4 times and finish with 1 slip stitch in the 3rd chain stitch at beginning of round, cut strand.
Round 2: 4 chain stitches, * 3 treble crochets around next chain-space, 2 chain stitches, 3 treble crochets around same chain-space, 1 chain stitch * repeat from *-* a total of 3 times and finish with 3 treble crochets around the last chain-space, 2 chain stitches, 2 treble crochets around the same chain-space and 1 slip stitch in the 3rd chain stitch at beginning of round, cut strand.
Round 3: * 3 treble crochets around next chain-space, 1 chain stitch, 3 treble crochets around next chain-space, 2 chain stitches, 3 treble crochets around same chain-space, 1 chain stitch *, repeat from *-* a total of 3 times and finish with 3 treble crochets around next chain-space, 1 chain stitch, 3 treble crochets around next chain-space, 2 chain stitches, 3 treble crochets around same chain-space, 1 chain stitch and 1 slip stitch in the 3rd chain stitch at beginning of round, cut strand.
Continue to increase in this way with 2 treble crochet-groups in each corner and 2 chain stitches between these treble crochet-groups and 1 treble crochet-group in the other chain-spaces with 1 chain stitch between each.
When square measures 15x15-15x15-18x18-18x18-21x21 cm cut the strand. Sew the square into the opening mid front - sew with small stitches edge to edge with the ridge so that the seam is flat.
