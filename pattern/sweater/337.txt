DROPS pointed and double pointed needles size 4 mm

Knitting Tension: 21 sts x 28 rows on needles size 4 mm in stocking sts. = 10 x 10 cm.

Garter sts (back and forth on needle): K 1st row, K 2nd row

Garter sts (on circular needles): P 1st round, K 2nd round

Pattern: See diagram M.3 and M.4. 
Knit M.4 in stocking sts. M.3 are knitted in garter sts, this means that 1 row in the diagram = K 2 rows. The earflaps are knitted in M.3, therefore it is necessary to cut and sew the threads for each stripe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Earflaps: Cast on 5 sts with light brown and needles size 4 mm. Knit in garter sts according to M.3 – see explanation above ( if you haven’t reach the final measures when finish with M.3 continue in the same colour as the last stripe) at the same time after 2 rows of garter sts, begin to inc – inc 1 st each side as follows: Make a yo inside the 2nd st each side –twist and knit the yo on the returning row, to avoid a hole – inc. 1 st each side on every 4th row 8-9-10 times = 21-23-25 sts. Continue in garter sts until the flap measures 8-9-10 cm. Put aside and knit another one.

Hat: Put one of the earflaps on needle size 4 mm, cast on  14-16-18  new sts in the last colour of M.3 for the back and knit in the other earflap on the same row = 56-62-68 sts. Knit 4 rows back and forth in garter sts over all sts – at the same time inc 1 st each side on every other row (as done for the earflaps) 2 times = 60-66-72 sts. Change to light brown and cast on 28-30-32 sts in between the earflaps for the front = 88-96-104 sts. Change to double pointed needles size 4 mm and continue to knit the hat round – now do all measures from this point! Knit 4 rows of garter sts over all sts, cut the thread. Begin at the centre back of the hat – continue in stocking sts over all sts after M.4 and until finished. NB: make sure the threads are not too tight when knitting with 2 colours. At the same time, when finished the lama pattern, bind off 8 sts evenly distributed on the 4 rounds marked with an arrow in diagram = 56-64-72 sts. Continue to bind off according to diagram = 7-8-9 sts, cut the thread, pull through the remaining sts and sew tight. The hat measures approx 25 cm from the centre front and to the top.
