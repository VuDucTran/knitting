RIDGE/GARTER STITCH (worked back and forth):
1 ridge = Knit 2 rows.

PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.2 and A.3. Diagram A.3 shows a knot. 
Diagram A.2 (snowman): The whole diagram is worked in stocking stitch. Worked with 3 balls, so that you avoid long carrying loops on the wrong side. In other words, work with 1 ball of medium grey Air/ grey Nepal on each side of jumper and 1 ball of pattern colour in middle of jumper. NOTE: To avoid holes when changing colours, you need to twist the strands together.

INCREASE TIP (sleeve):
Work until 1 st remains before marker, 1 YO, knit 2 sts (marker sits between these 2 sts) , 1 YO. On next round knit yarn overs twisted to avoid holes.

JUMPER:
Front and back pieces (back piece with or without snowman) are worked back and forth separately with circular needle. This is to make it easier to work pattern.
