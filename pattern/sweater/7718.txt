BACK PIECE:
Cast on 8 sts with 1 strand BabyAlpaca Silk and 1 strand Kid-Silk (= 2 strands) and divide them on 4 double pointed needles size 5 mm (= 2 sts on per needle). Work according to A.1 (= 8 repetitions of A.1 in width). When the first 15-15-19-19 rounds in A.1 have been worked, displace beg of round 1 st towards the left first on every other round, then every 4th round – i.e. beg of round is always before first YO in diagram so make it less visible. Beg of round at the end will be in middle of the first repetition of A.1. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION Switch to circular needle when needed. When A.1 has been worked one time vertically = 144-144-176-176 sts on round and piece measures approx. 22-22-28-28 cm in diameter. Insert 8 markers in piece, insert 1st marker in 1st st on round, then insert 7 markers 17-17-21-21 sts apart, markers are directly over tip on each leaf. Work in GARTER ST - see explanation above, AT THE SAME TIME on first round inc 1 st on each side of markers. Inc with 1 YO on each side of sts with marker – on next round P YO twisted to avoid holes = 16 inc sts per round. Inc like this every other round a total of 1-2-1-2 times = 160-176-192-208 sts. Continue in garter st until piece measures 26-28-32-34 cm in diameter.

On next round K, AT THE SAME TIME cast off all sts between 2nd and 3rd marker and 7th and 8th marker + 1 st on each side of marker for armholes (= cast off 23-25-27-29 sts in each side). P next round, AT THE SAME TIME cast on 23-25-27-29 new (loose) sts over the cast off sts between 2nd and 3rd marker and 7th and 8th marker. When all sts are cast on again, there are 160-176-192-208 sts on needle. 

Then work as follows: Work A.2 over all sts, AT THE SAME TIME inc 1 st on each side of sts with marker on every round with star (= 16 sts per inc round). Work A.2 2 times vertically = 288-304-320-336 sts. Piece measures approx. 56-58-62-64 cm in diameter.

LEFT FRONT PIECE:
Then work as follows: Keep sts between 2nd and 4th marker on needle, slip the remaining sts on a stitch holder = 72-76-80-84 sts on needle. Work in GARTER ST - see explanation above - back and forth over these sts, AT THE SAME TIME at the end of every row slip the last 2 sts on stitch holder (do not work them, turn). NOTE: Continue with inc on each side of the 3rd marker every 4th row. Continue until 32 sts remain on needle. Slip the last 32 sts on stitch holder. 

RIGHT FRONT PIECE:
Slip sts between 6th and 8th marker on circular needle size 5 mm, and work the same way as on left front piece. 

Then K all sts from stitch holder from RS back onto circular needle size 5 mm - pick up and twist yarn between every time st on stitch holder in each side is slipped on needle (i.e. between every other st to avoid holes in transition) = approx. 352-376-400-424 sts. Work 2 ridges. Loosely cast off with K from RS as follows: K 1, ((** insert right needle in between the first 2 sts on left needle (i.e. between sts on needle, not through sts), make 1 YO on right needle, pull YO forwards between sts and slip YO on left needle **, repeat from **-** 2 more times (= 3 new sts on left needle). * K first st on left needle, pass first st on right needle over last st worked *)), repeat from *-* 6 times in total and repeat from ((-)) along the entire jacket until 1 st remains, cut the yarn and pull it through last st.

SLEEVES:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. Cast on 30-30-32-34 sts on double pointed needles size 5 mm with 1 strand BabyAlpaca Silk and 1 strand Kid-Silk (= 2 strands). Work 4 ridges, then work in stocking st. Insert 1 marker mid under sleeve. When piece measures 6 cm, inc 1 st on each side of marker under sleeve. Inc like this every 4-3½-3½-4 cm a total of 7-9-10-10 times = 44-48-52-54 sts. Work until piece measures 35-40-44-48 cm, cast off. Knit another sleeve.
