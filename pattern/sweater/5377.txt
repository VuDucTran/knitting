PATTERN: 
See diagram M.1. To make the pattern the same in each side, work first row in diagram at the end of first row from RS and at the end of the second row from WS. I.e. all rows where YOs and sts-tog are worked, must be worked at the end of row. No of sts in diagram will vary from 7 to 17. SHORT ROWS: 
Work 6 rows over all sts, * work until marker in one side, turn, tighten thread and work back. Work 1 row over all sts, turn, work until marker in the other side, turn, tighten thread and work back. Work 5 rows over all sts *, repeat from *-*. I.e. work 6 rows (= 3 ridges) over the middle 70-76-78-86-92 sts and 8 rows (4 ridges) over sts in each side in every repetition.

BOLERO: 
Work sideways back and forth on circular needle from sleeve to sleeve. Then fold double and sew sleeve and side seams. 

Cast on 52-58-62-66-70 sts with 2 threads Kid-Silk on circular needle size 3.5 mm. Remove 1 thread and work in GARTER ST - see explanation above! REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! When piece measures 8 cm (= sleeve), loosely cast on 27-29-30-34-37 new sts in each side (cast on at the end of the next 2 rows) = 106-116-122-134-144 sts. Insert 2 markers in the piece, after 18-20-22-24-26 sts in from each side (= 70-76-78-86-92 sts between markers). 
Continue in garter st and PATTERN over the outermost sts in each side – see explanation above – AT THE SAME TIME work SHORT ROWS – see explanation above!  
When piece measures approx. 44-49-54-59-64 cm (incl sleeve), loosely cast off  27-29-30-34-37 sts in each side (cast off at the beg of the next 2 rows) – NOTE: Adjust to cast off after 1 whole repetition of diagram M.1.
