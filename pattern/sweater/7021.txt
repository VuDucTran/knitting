Then work as follows: A.1 (= band), A.2 (= 5 sts), A.3 (= 12 sts) over the next 132-144-156-168-180-192 sts, work A.4 (= 6 sts), finish with A.1 (= band). When A.3 has been worked 1 time vertically, there are 131-141-151-161-171-181 sts on needle. Continue with pattern as before but work A.5 over every repetition of A.3. When A.5 has been worked 1 time vertically, continue as follows: A.1, A.2, A.5, P 1, stocking st over the next 89-99-109-119-129-139 sts, A.5, A.4, A.1. Continue pattern like this.

REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION  AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 6 cm, dec 1 st on each side of every marker (= 4 sts dec). Repeat dec every 6½-7½-8½-9½-10½-11½ cm 3 more times = 115-125-135-145-155-165 sts. When piece measures 28-31-34-37-40-43 cm, cast off 6 sts in each side for armholes (i.e. 3 sts on both sides of every marker) and finish each piece separately.

When piece measures 38-42-46-50-54-58 cm, cast off the middle 17-19-21-23-23-25 sts for neck. Then cast off 1 st on next row towards the neck = 12-12-12-13-15-15 sts remain on the shoulder.

LEFT FRONT PIECE:

When piece measures 39-43-47-51-55 cm, slip the first 10-12-12-14-13-15 sts from mid front on a stitch holder for neck. Then cast off at beg of every row from RS: 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2 times = 12-12-12-13-15-15 sts remain on the shoulder – work the sts that do not fit the pattern in stocking st. Cast off when piece measures 40-44-48-52-56-60 cm.
