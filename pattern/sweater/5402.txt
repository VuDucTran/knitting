RAGLAN: 
Dec on each side of all 4 markers, i.e. 8 dec per round. 
Dec as follows from RS: 
Work until 2 sts remain before marker, K 2 tog, marker, slip 1 st as if to K, K 1, psso. 
Dec as follows from WS: 
Work until 2 sts remain before marker, P 2 tog, marker, then P 2 twisted tog (i.e. work in back loop of st instead of front).
---------------------------------------------------------

BODY:  
Worked in the round on circular needle. 
Cast on 158-166-174-182-190 sts on circular needle size 3 mm with Merino. K 1 round, then work rib as follows: * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* over 20 sts, K 2, repeat from *-* the rest of the round (there are 4 K sts mid front, i.e. round does not start in the side). When piece measures 5 cm, switch to circular needle size 4 mm. Work next round as follows: P 2, K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 P), K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2, K 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 K), P 2, K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 P), K 1, 1 YO, K 2 (= mid front), 1 YO, K 1, P 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 P), K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2, K 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 K), P 2, K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2 in each of the next 2 sts (= 4 P), K 1, 1 YO, K 1, P 2. Work the rest of the round as follows: 
SIZE 3/4 YEARS: K 1, * K 2 tog, K 4, K 2 tog, K 5 *, repeat from *-* the rest of round.
SIZE 5/6 YEARS: * K 2 tog, K 5 *, repeat from *-* the rest of round. 
SIZE 7/8 YEARS: K 8, * K 2 tog, K 5 *, repeat from *-* the rest of round. 
SIZE 9/10 YEARS: K 7, * K 2 tog, K 5, K 2 tog, K 6 *, repeat from *-* the rest of round.
SIZE 11/12 YEARS: K 6, * K 2 tog, K 6 *, repeat from *-* the rest of round. 
There are now 160-168-176-184-192 sts on needle. Continue as follows: Diagram M.1 over the first 60 sts (i.e. part A over the first 14 sts, part B over the next 4 sts, part C over the next 24 sts, part D over the next 4 sts and part E over the last 14 sts), then diagram M.2 over the remaining sts. Count 14-16-18-20-22 sts outwards on each side of diagram M.1 and insert a marker (these marks the sides), there are 72-76-80-84-88 sts between markers on back piece. 
REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!  When piece measures 26-29-32-35-38 cm, cast off 6 sts in each side (i.e. 3 sts on each side of each markers) = 148-156-164-172-180 sts remain on needle. Put piece aside and work the sleeves.  

SLEEVE: 
Worked in the round on double pointed needles. 
Cast on 40-44-44-48-48 sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm with Merino. K 1 round, continue in rib = K 2/P 2 for 5 cm. Insert a marker in the middle of the first 2 K sts (= mid under sleeve). Switch to double pointed needles size 4 mm, continue to K the first 2 sts and work the remaining sts in diagram M.2 until finished measurements. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 8-8-9-9-10 cm, inc 1 st on each side of the 2 K sts mid under sleeve. Repeat inc every 3-3½-3-3½-3 cm a total of 7-7-9-9-11 times (work the inc sts in diagram M.2) = 54-58-62-66-70 sts. When piece measures 30-33-37-40-44 cm, cast off 6 sts mid under sleeve (i.e. 3 sts on each side of marker) = 48-52-56-60-64 sts remain on needle. Put piece aside and knit another sleeve.

YOKE: 
Slip sleeves on to same circular needle as body where armholes were cast off = 244-260-276-292-308 sts. Insert a marker in all transitions between sleeves and body = 4 markers. Continue with 1 K st on each side of all markers and work the other sts as before. AT THE SAME TIME on 2nd round, beg to dec for RAGLAN – see explanation above! Repeat dec every other round a total of 15-15-16-17-18 times and then every 4th round a total of 4-6-7-7-8 times. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures approx. 35-39-43-47-51 cm (adjust so that so that you are on a round with 6 K sts mid front in pattern), work the middle 14 sts tog 2 by 2 = 7 sts (the middle 6 sts K 2 tog and the 4 sts on each side P 2 tog). On next round, slip the middle 17 sts on a stitch holder for neck (= the entire diagram M.1C). Continue the piece back and forth from mid front until finished measurements - AT THE SAME TIME cast off at the beg of every row in each side: 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 2 times. After all dec for raglan and cast offs for neck, 56-56-56-64-64 sts remain on needle. 

NECK:
Switch to double pointed needle size 3 mm, knit up approx. 29 to 35 sts at the front of neck (incl sts on stitch holder) = approx. 85 to 99 sts on needle. K 1 round while at the same time adjusting no of sts so that there are 8 sts over each sleeve, 24-28-28-32-32 sts over back piece and 35-35-35-43-43 sts over front piece (do not inc or dec over the middle 17 sts) = 75-79-79-91-91 sts on needle. Work rib as follows: Continue the 2 sts over each raglan in K 2, then P 2, K 2 and P 2 over each sleeve, work sts over back piece P 2/K 2, work the middle 17 sts over front piece as follows: P 2, K 3, P 2, K 3, P 2, K 3, P 2, work the other sts on each side K 2/P 2. When neck edge measures 5-6-6-7-7 cm, loosely cast off with K over K and P over P. 

ASSEMBLY: 
Sew the openings under the sleeves tog.
