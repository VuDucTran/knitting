Cast on 44-44-48 (52-52-54) sts (incl 1 edge st each side for assembly) on circular needle size 2.5 mm in navy. Knit Rib-1 – with edge st in garter st throughout - for 4-4-5 (5-6-6) cm. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and continue knitting pattern – at the same time, inc 1 st each side: 5-7-7 (9-11-12) times on every 4-3.5-4 (3.5-3-3) cm = 54-58-62 (70-74-78) sts.

Assembly: Sew the shoulder seams.

Cast off all sts apart from  the 3 garter sts on each side mid front. Now, knit the addition for the zip as follows: continue to knit the 3 garter sts to the same length as zip, cast off. Sew in the zip – for the sizes where this is too long; sew it in from the top and cut it off at the bottom to the right length – sew over the cut of the zip so it doesn’t fray. Double over the addition towards WS, over the zip and sew in. Sew the sleeve seams; sew the sleeves onto the jersey.
