Body: Knit the sweater in the round on circular needles and cut steeks for armholes afterwards. Cast on 132-144-152 (164-172) sts on smaller circular needles with marine and knit 5 cm  rib. Change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 24-24-28 (28-32) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 156-168-180 (192-204) sts. When the work measures 22-25-30 (32-34) cm , knit pattern as follows: Pattern 1, Pattern 2 (start at the appropriate arrow and knit pattern over the front, start at the appropriate arrow again and knit pattern over the back), Pattern 3 and then knit the rest with marine. 
At the same time, when the work measures 26-28-31 (32-33) cm , increase 5 sts on each side (these sts are for the armhole steeks and are not knit into the pattern). When the work measures 41-44-49 (51-53) cm  (adjust for Pattern 3, in such a way that 7 rows of the pattern remain), bind off the center 28-28 (30-30-32) sts for the neck in the front and knit the rest back and forth on the needles. Then bind off for the neck every other row: 2 sts 1 time, 1 st 2 times. When the work measures 43-46-51 (53-55) cm , bind off the center 34-34 (36-36-38) sts for the neck in the back. Then dec 1 st at each neck edge on the next row. Bind off all sts when the work measures 45-48-53 (55-57) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 32-36-40 (40-44) sts on smaller double pointed needles with marine; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and stockinette st, increasing 8-4-4 (8-6) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40-44 (48-50) sts. Then increase 1 st each side of marker 18-20-22 (22-23) times:
Size 3/4: alternately every 2nd and 3rd row
Sizes 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: alternately every 3rd and 4th row
= 76-80-88 (92-96) sts. When the work measures 16-20-23 (27-30) cm  knit Pattern 1 (centering the pattern on the sleeve) and then knit the rest with marine. When the work measures 26-30-33 (37-40) cm , knit 2 cm  reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body. Bind off all sts. 

Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the center of the increased sts on each side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 st from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 st from first seam. Cut up for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approx. 76-90 sts around the neck on smaller double pointed needles with marine and knit 2.5 cm  rib, purl 1 row (for the turning edge) and knit 2.5 cm  stockinette st. Bind off, fold the edge over against the wrong side and sew. Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a st in the last row of plain knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a st on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand.

Circumference of the hat: 47-50-51 (52-54) cm 

Hat: Cast on 160-170-172 (176-184) sts on smaller circular needles and knit 7 cm  rib. Change to larger circular needles, knit 7-8-9 (9-10) cm  stockinette st and decrease 66-70-70 (72-76) sts evenly distributed across row = 94-100-102 (104-108) sts. Then dec 15-16-17 (17-18) sts evenly distributed across the row every 6th row until approx. 17 sts remain. Pull a double strand of yarn through these sts and sew it in. Make a small tassel and sew it to the top.
