DROPS 3.5 mm  and 6 mm  circular and double pointed needles, or sizes needed to obtain correct gauge.
Gauge: 14 sts x 16 rows on larger needles in pattern = 10 x 10 cm 

Rib: * K 1, P 1 *

Pattern: See chart below (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette st. Arrows indicate the starting point for different sizes.

Body: Cast on 96-104 (112-120-128) sts on smaller circular needles with natural; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 5 cm  rib, change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 14-14 (14-14-14) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 110-118 (126-134-142) sts. When the work measures 13-16 (20-22-24) cm , knit Pattern 1 (start at the appropriate arrow, knit pattern over the 55-59 (63-67-71) sts for the front - start at the arrow again and knit pattern over the back sts), then knit Pattern 2. At the same time, when the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , divide the work into two parts for armholes and knit the rest of the front and back separately. 


Back: = 55-59 (63-67-71) sts. After Pattern 2 knit as much of Pattern 1 as possible to finished dimensions. At the same time, when the work measures 38-41 (45-47-49) cm , bind off the center 23-23 (23-25-25) sts for the neck and on the next row dec 1 st at each neck edge. Bind off the remaining sts for the shoulder when the work measures 40-43 (47-49-51) cm .

Front: = 55-59 (63-67-71) sts. Knit like the back, but when 3 rows of Pattern 2 remain bind off the center st for the neck. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row 5 sts 1 time, 3-3 (3-4-4) sts 1 time, 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2 times. Bind off the remaining sts for the shoulder when the work measures 40-43 (47-49-51) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 26-28 (28-32-32) sts on smaller double pointed needles with natural; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and stockinette st, increasing 2-2 (2-2-2) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 28-30 (30-34-34) sts. Inc 1 st each side of marker 12-12 (15-13-15) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: every 4th row 
= 52-54 (60-60-64) sts. At the same time, when the work measures 9-12 (11-15-19) cm , knit: 
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6: as much as possible of Pattern 3 (center the pattern on the sleeve)
Sizes 7/8 + 9/10 + 11/12: Pattern 2 (center the pattern on the sleeve), then as much as possible of Pattern 1. Bind off when the work measures 27-30 (34-37-41) cm . 

Assembly: Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approx. 80-90 sts on smaller double pointed needles with natural around the neck and knit 3 cm  rib back and forth from the center front, change to rose pink, knit 1 row, bind off loosely. Sew the right part of the neck over the left part at the center front. Sew the sleeves to the body.
