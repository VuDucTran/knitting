DROPS 3 mm  and 3.5 mm  circular and double pointed needles, or sizes needed to obtain correct gauge.

5-7 DROPS "Kokos" buttons (button no. 516)
Gauge: 23 sts and 30 rows on larger needles and pattern = 10 x 10 cm 

Pattern: See charts. One chart equals one repeat of the pattern. The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette stitch. 

Body: Cardigan is knit in the round with steeks for the center front and the armholes. Cast on 181-193-205 (217-229-241) sts plus 5 steek sts (total 186-198-210 (222-234-246) sts) on smaller circular needles with black. Join, being careful not to twist the sts. Place a marker at the join and knit 8 rows stockinette stitch. Purl 1 row for folding edge. Measure the work from here. Knit one repeat of Pattern 1. Do not knit pattern over the 5 steek sts. After Pattern 1 change to larger circular needles and knit Pattern 2. After 4-5-5 (6-6-7) repeats, knit the first 7 rows of Pattern 2 again. After this, knit Pattern 3 once and then Pattern 4 for 4-4-5 (5-6-6) repeats, then knit 7 rows of Pattern 4 and then knit Pattern 5. 
At the same time, when the work measures 29-32-34 (37-40-43) cm , knit the next row as follows: 5 steek sts at center front, 45-48-51 (54-57-60) sts for the front, cast on 5 sts for armhole steek, 90-96-102 (108-114-120) sts for the back, cast on 5 sts for armhole steek, 46-49-52 (55-58-61) sts for the front. (The steek sts are not knit in pattern). 
When the work measures 37-41-44 (47-50-53) cm , bind off the center 8-8-8 (8-10-10) sts and the 5 steek sts in the front for the neck (total of 13-13-13 (13-15-15) sts). At the beginning of the next row cast on 5 new steek sts over the bound-off sts and continue to knit in the round. Decrease for the neck on each side of the 5 steek sts every other row as follows: 2 sts 4 times by knitting 3 sts together and after that 1 st 5 times by knitting 2 sts together. On the left front decrease 1 st more on the last decrease. 
When the work measures 43-47-51 (55-59-63) cm  sts, bind off the center 32-32-32 (32-34-34) sts in the back for the neck. Then bind off 1 st at each neck edge on the next row. Bind off for the shoulders after Pattern 5. The work measures approximately 45-49-53 (57-61-65) cm .
