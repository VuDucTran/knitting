Pattern: See chart (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette stitch. Arrows indicate starting points for different sizes. The arrows on the left side of the chart are for the sleeves; the arrows on the right side of the chart are for the body.


Body: The sweater is knit in the round with steeks for the armholes. Cast on 132-140 (144-152-160) sts on smaller circular needles with red; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib, change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 24-28 (36-40-44) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 156-168 (180-192-204) sts. When the work measures 4-5 (5-4-4) cm , begin Pattern 1 -- start at the appropriate arrow and center the pattern across the front. When the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , inc 5 sts at each side (these sts are for the steeks and are not knit into the pattern). Front and back each = 78-84 (90-96-102) sts.

When the work measures 36-39 (43-45-47) cm , bind off the center front 28-28 (30-32-32) sts for the neck and knit the rest of the work back and forth on the needles. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row 2 sts 1 time, 1 st 2 times. At the same time, when the work measures 39-42 (46-48-50) cm , bind off the center back 34-34 (36-38-38) sts for the neck and knit the rest of each side separately. On the next row bind off 1 st at each back neck edge. Bind off the remaining sts for the shoulders when the work measures 40-43 (47-49-51) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 32-36 (36-36-40) sts on smaller double pointed needles with red; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and stockinette st, increasing 8-4 (8-12-10) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40 (44-48-50) sts. Inc 1 st each side of marker 18-20 (22-20-23) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Size 9/10: every 4th row 
Size 11/12: alternately every 3rd and 4th row 
= 76-80 (88-88-96) sts. Knit with red in stockinette st until the work measures 5-5 (4-6-6) cm , then knit Pattern 1, starting at the appropriate arrow on the chart and centering the pattern on the sleeve. 
When the work measures 27-30 (34-37-41) cm , knit 2 cm  reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body. Bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the center of the steek sts at each side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 st from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 st from first seam. Cut for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. 
Pick up approx. 76-90 sts on smaller needles with red around the neck and knit 2 cm  rib. 
Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: Sew alternately a st in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a st on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand.
