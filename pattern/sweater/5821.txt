BODY:
Worked back and forth on circular needle from mid front. Cast on 280-304-328-352-384 sts (incl 1 edge st in each side towards mid front) on circular needle size 3.5 mm with beige brown Karisma. Work first row as follows from RS: 1 edge st in GARTER ST - see explanation above - * K 6, P 2 *, repeat from *-* until 7 sts remain and finish with K 6 and 1 edge st in GARTER ST. Continue rib like this for 3-3-4-4-5 cm – adjust so that next row is worked from RS. Now dec 1 st on each side of every K-section by working all 6 K sts as follows (2 P sts are worked as before): Slip 1 st as if to K, K 1, psso, K until 2 sts remain, K 2 tog.
Repeat dec on next row from RS = 140-152-164-176-192 sts. Work 1 row with K over K and P over P. Switch to circular needle size 4 mm and K 1 row from RS while AT THE SAME TIME adjusting no of sts in the 2 largest sizes to 140-152-164-175-191 sts. Now insert 2 markers in the piece, 35-38-41-44-48 sts in from each side (= 70-76-82-87-95 sts between markers on back piece). Then work in stocking st with 1 edge st in garter st in each side towards mid front. When piece measures 7-8-8-9-9 cm, dec 1 st on each side of both markers – READ DECREASE TIP (= 4 sts dec). Repeat dec every 7-7-8-8-9 cm 2 more times = 128-140-152-163-179 sts. When piece measures 26-28-31-33-35 cm, cast off 6 sts in each side for armholes (i.e. 3 sts on each side of both markers) = 58-64-70-75-83 sts on back piece and 29-32-35-38-42 sts on each front piece. Put piece aside and knit the sleeves.

SLEEVE:
Worked in the round on double pointed needles.
Cast on 36-36-40-44-44 sts on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm with beige brown. Work rib (= K 2/P 2). When piece measures 4 cm, K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME dec 4-4-4-8-8 sts evenly = 32-32-36-36-36 sts. Switch to double pointed needles size 4 mm and work in stocking st. Insert a marker at beg of round (= mid under sleeve). When piece measures 7 cm, inc 2 sts mid under sleeve (i.e. 1 st on each side of marker). Repeat inc every 2-2-2½-2½-2½ cm, 8-11-10-12-14 more times = 50-56-58-62-66 sts. When piece measures 27-31-34-39-44 cm, cast off 6 sts mid under sleeve (i.e. 3 sts on each side of marker) = 44-50-52-56-60 sts remain on sleeve. Put piece aside and knit another sleeve.

YOKE:
Slip sleeves on to same circular needle as body where armholes were cast off = 204-228-244-263-287 sts. Work 3-4-2-3-4 cm in stocking st with 1 edge st in garter st in each side with beige brown. AT THE SAME TIME dec 5-1-3-8-4 sts evenly on last row = 199-227-241-255-283 sts. Then work next row as follows from RS: 1 edge st in garter st, work diagram A.1 until 2 sts remain on needle (= 14-16-17-18-20 repetitions), work 1st st in A.1 (i.e. this st follows the pattern so that A.1 beg and ends the same way inside edge st in each side towards mid front but do not dec in this st), finish with 1 edge st in garter st as before. Continue the pattern like this. After A.1 87-99-105-111-123 sts remain on needle. P 1 row from WS. Then work an elevation in the back of neck with short rows as follows (1st row = RS): K until 18-19-20-22-26 sts remain, turn, tighten thread and P until 18-19-20-22-26 sts remain in the other side. Turn, tighten thread and K until 36-38-40-44-52 sts remain, turn, tighten thread and P until 36-38-40-44-52 sts remain in the other side, turn, tighten thread and K the rest of row. Then P 1 row from WS while AT THE SAME TIME dec 27-35-37-39-47 sts evenly = 60-64-68-72-76 sts. Piece measures approx. 40-43-47-50-53 cm up to shoulder. 
Put sts on a thread or stitch holder (or keep them on the needle), while working the front bands. 
BAND:
Knit up from RS approx. 84 to 112 sts along right front piece inside 1 edge st on circular needle size 3.5 mm with beige brown. P 1 row from WS while AT THE SAME TIME inc evenly to 101-105-113-121-129 sts. Work next row as follows from RS: 2 edge sts in garter st, * K 2, P 2 *, repeat from *-* until 3 sts remain and finish with K 2 and 1 edge st in garter st. Continue rib like this. AT THE SAME TIME after 1 cm, cast off for 5-5-6-6-6 button holes evenly. 1 button hole = work 2 sts tog and make 1 YO (casting off P 2 seen from RS will look more pretty). Upper button hole should be approx. 0.5-1 cm from neck edge and bottom hole approx. 4-4-5-5-6 cm from bottom edge. When band measures 2.5 cm, cast off K over K and P over P. Repeat along left front piece but do not cast off for button holes on left band.

NECK:
Knit up from RS approx. 70 to 86 sts around the neck (also over bands) on circular needle size 3.5 mm with beige brown. P 1 row from WS while AT THE SAME TIME inc evenly to 78-82-86-90-94 sts. Work next row as follows from RS: 2 edge sts in garter st, * K 2, P 2 *, repeat from *-* until 4 sts remain and finish with K 2 and 2 edge sts in garter st. Continue rib like this. When neck edge measures approx. 2.5 cm, loosely cast off K over K and P over P.
