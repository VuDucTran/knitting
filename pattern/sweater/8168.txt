PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 and A.2. Choose diagram for your size.

KNITTING TIP (for multi-coloured pattern):
To avoid the knitting tension becoming tighter when working the pattern, it is important that the strands do not pull at the back of the piece. You can increase a needle size when working pattern if this is a problem.
----------------------------------------------------------

TUNIC: 
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, top down. You can work an elevation in the back of the neck to get a better fit, so that the yoke is a little higher in the neck. You can choose to leave out this elevation; the neck will then be the same front and back – see description of elevation further down the page. After the yoke, the body is worked in the round with circular needle. The sleeve edges are worked in the round with double pointed needles, top down.

NECKLINE:
Cast on 88-88-92-96-96-100 stitches with short circular needle size 2.5 mm and with red. Insert 1 marker at the beginning of the round (= mid back). Work rib (= knit 2 / purl 2) for 1½ cm. Change to circular needle size 3 mm. Knit 1 round where you increase 7-17-18-19-24-25 stitches evenly on round = 95-105-110-115-120-125 stitches.
Now work an elevation in the back of the neck or go straight to working the yoke if you do not want an elevation.

ELEVATION IN BACK OF NECK:
Skip this section if you do not want an elevation. 
Knit 8 stitches past the marker, turn, tighten strand and purl 16 stitches back. Turn, tighten strand and knit 24 stitches, turn, tighten strand and purl 32 stitches back. Continue working 8 more stitches each time you turn until you have worked over a total of 48-48-48-64-64-80 stitches, turn and knit to mid back.

YOKE:
Continue by working A.1 (= 19-21-22-23-24-25 repeats in width) and read KNITTING TIP! REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! Change to longer circular needle when necessary. When A.1 has been completed, there are 228-252-264-276-288-300 stitches on the round. Knit 1 round where the number of stitches is adjusted to 236-252-260-280-292-304 stitches, continue with red for 0-1-2-0-1-2 cm. The yoke now measures approx. 13-14-15-16-17-18 cm mid front (measured without the rib in neck). The next round is worked as follows: Work 35-38-39-42-44-46 stitches (= half back piece), place the next 48-50-52-56-58-60 stitches on 1 thread for sleeve edge (without working them), cast on 6-6-8-8-8-8 new stitches (= in side under sleeve), work 70-76-78-84-88-92 stitches (= front piece), place the next 48-50-52-56-58-60 stitches on 1 thread for sleeve edge (without working them), cast on 6-6-8-8-8-8 new stitches (= in side under sleeve), work 35-38-39-42-44-46 stitches (= half back piece). Body and sleeve edges are finished separately. THE PIECE IS NOW MEASURED FROM HERE!

BODY:
= 152-164-172-184-192-200 stitches. Continue with stocking stitch and red. When the piece measures 19-22-25-28-31-34 cm from the separation, knit 1 round where you increase 0-4-4-0-0-0 stitches evenly on round = 152-168-176-184-192-200 stitches. Work A.2 over all stitches (= 19-21-22-23-24-25 repeats of 8 stitches). Continue with red when A.2 has been completed. Purl 1 round (= the folding round), then work stocking stitch for 7 cm. Cast off.

SLEEVE EDGE:
Place the stitches from one of the threads on double pointed needles size 3.5 mm and, in addition, knit up 1 stitch in each of the 6-6-8-8-8-8 stitches cast on under the sleeve in red = 54-56-60-64-66-68 stitches. Insert 1 marker in the middle of the 6-6-8-8-8-8 stitches = mid under sleeve. Knit 1 round where you increase 2-0-0-0-2-0 stitches evenly on round = 56-56-60-64-68-68 stitches. Work rib in the round (= knit 2 / purl 2) for 1½ cm, then cast off with knit over knit and purl over purl. Work the other sleeve edge in the same way.

ASSEMBLY:
Fold the bottom 7 cm on the body in towards the wrong side of the tunic (at the folding round) and fasten neatly with small stitches. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
