Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comKnitting tension: Remember needle size is only a guide. 13 stitches x 17 rows with needle size 7 mm and stocking stitch = 10 x 10 cm.

Rib: * K3, P3 *, repeat from *-*.

Ridge/Garter stitch (back and forth on needle):
1 ridge = Knit 2 rows.

Band: The band is worked in garter stitch to finished length. To work a neat band you need to work a little tightly.

Decrease tip (for raglan):
All decreases are worked from the right side!
Decrease as follows in transitions between body and sleeves:
(start 3 stitches before the marker thread): K2 together, K2 (marker thread sits in middle of these 2 stitches), slip 1 stitch as if to knit, K1, pass slipped stitch over.

Knitting tip: If your knitting tension is not right in height and you work too tightly, the raglan decreases will be too short and the armholes too small. You can adjust for this by working 1 extra round without decreases regularly between decreases.

Buttonholes: Work buttonholes on right band. 1 buttonhole is worked as follows from the edge seen from the right side: 4 stitches garter stitch, 1 yarn over, K2 together. On next row purl yarn over twisted.

Work buttonholes when piece measures:

---------------------------------------------------------

Body: The jacket is worked back and forth with circular needle from mid front. Cast on 95-107-113-119-131 stitches (incl. 4 band stitches in each side towards mid front) with circular needle size 6 mm and 1 strand pink Muskat + 1 strand cerise Vivaldi (= 2 strands). Work Stripe pattern (body) - see description above - NOTE: start with 1 row purl from the wrong side, then work 3 cm rib with 4 band stitches in garter stitch and knit 3 in each side - see description of band above. Remember buttonholes on right band. After the rib, change to circular needle size 7 mm and continue with stocking stitch to finished length. At the same time, adjust the number of stitches to 92-100-108-116-124 stitches on first row after rib. Then insert 1 marker thread 25-27-29-31-33 stitches in from each side. There are now 42-46-50-54-58 stitches between marker threads mid back. Remember the knitting tension! When piece measures 10 cm, increase 1 stitch on each side of the marker threads in each side every 10 cm a total of 2 times = 100-108-116-124-132 m. When piece measures 23-25-27-28-29 cm work the next row as follows (from the right side): 24-26-28-29-31 stitches = right front piece, cast off 6-6-6-8-8 stitches for armhole, work 40-44-48-50-54 stitches = back piece, cast off 6-6-6-8-8 stitches for armhole, work 24-26-28-29-31 stitches = left front piece. Lay piece to one side and work sleeves.

Sleeve: Cast on 28-28-35-35-35 stitches with doubled pointed needles size 6 mm and 1 strand pink Muskat + 1 strand cerise Vivaldi (= 2 strands). Work Stripe pattern (sleeves) - see description above - NOTE: Start with 1 round stocking stitch, then work 2 rounds rib (= K3/ P4). On the next round decrease all P4 to P3 = 24-24-30-30-30 stitches. Continue with this rib until piece measures 3 cm. Change to double pointed needles size 7 mm and continue with stocking stitch to finished length. At the same time, on the first row after the rib adjust the number of stitches to 22-24-26-26-26 stitches. When piece measures 6 cm increase 2 stitches mid under sleeve every 7.5-8-9-6.5-6 cm a total of 5-5-5-7-8 times = 32-34-36-40-42 stitches. When piece measures 38-41-44-48-50 cm cast off 6-6-6-8-8 stitches mid under sleeve = 26-28-30-32-34 stitches. Lay piece to one side and work 1 more sleeve.

Yoke: Place sleeves on same circular needle as body where you have cast off stitches for armholes = 140-152-164-172-184 stitches. Insert 1 marker thread in all transitions between body and sleeves (= 4 marker threads). Work 2-1-1-2-2 rows before starting to decrease.

Raglan: Decrease 1 stitch on each side of all marker threads (= 8 decreases per row). Decrease every 2nd row - see Decrease tip: 9-10-11-12-13 times.

Neckline: At the same time, when piece measures 31-33-36-37-39 cm - adjust so that you have worked at least 2 rows with the colour in the last stripe before the neck starts (= 1 strand coral Muskat + 1 strand raspberry Vivaldi) - place the outermost 8-8-9-8-9 stitches in each side on 1 thread for neck. Then decrease in each side towards neck every 2nd row: 2 stitches 1-0-0-0-0 time 1 stitch 1-3-3-4-4 times.
After all the decreases to raglan and neck there are 46-50-52-52-54 stitches left on needle.

Neck: Knit up approx. 11 to 15 stitches in each side at front of neck (incl. stitches from thread) with 1 strand coral Muskat + 1 strand raspberry Vivaldi (= the same colours as at top of sleeves and body). Place all stitches on circular needle size 6 mm = approx. 68 to 84 stitches. Purl 1 row from the wrong side at the same time as you decrease evenly to 44-46-48-50-55 stitches, then knit 1 row from the right side before casting off loosely with purl from the wrong side - so the cast-off edge is not tight, you can make 1 yarn over after approx. every 5th stitch at the same time as you cast off (yarn overs cast off as normal).

Assembly: Sew opening under sleeves.

Crochet edge: Work 1 row of chain-spaces around bottom of both sleeves, around neck, down both front pieces and along the bottom edge of body. Work with hook size 4.5 mm and lime Vivaldi as follows: 1 double crochet in first stitch, * 5 chain stitches, skip approx. 1 cm, 1 double crochet in next stitch *, repeat from *-* and finish with 1 slip stitch in first double crochet at beginning of round.
