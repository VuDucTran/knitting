Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comGauge: 20 sts x 26 rows on larger needles in pattern = 10 x 10 cm 

Rib: * K 1 st into back of st, P 1 * 

Pattern: See charts below (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette st. Arrows indicate the starting point for different sizes on the chart for Pattern 1. «Fugl» = «bird».


Body: The sweater is knit in the round with steeks cut for armholes. Cast on 130-138 (144-152-160) sts on smaller circular needles with marine; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 5 cm  rib, change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 26-30 (36-40-44) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 156-168 (180-192-204) sts. When the work measures 11-14 (17-18-20) cm , knit Pattern 1 (start at the appropriate arrow and knit pattern over the 78-84-90-96-102 sts for the front, start at the arrow again and knit pattern over the sts for the back). 
Then knit Bird pattern. Establish pattern as follows: Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: * 3-6-9 sts marine, 3 repeats of Bird pattern, 3-6-9 sts marine *, repeat * - * over the back. 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: * 0-3 sts marine, 4 repeats of Bird pattern, 0-3 sts marine *, repeat * - * over the back. 
At the same time, when the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , increase 4 sts at each side for armhole steeks (these sts are not knit into the pattern - if you do not wish to cut steeks divide the work into two parts here and knit the rest of the front and back separately). After the Birds knit 5-5 (6-7-7) cm  marine, then Pattern 1 (start at the arrow and knit pattern over the front, start at the arrow again and knit pattern over the back) and then knit the rest with marine. 
At the same time, when the work measures 36-39 (43-45-47) cm , bind off the center front 28-28 (30-32-32) sts for the neck and knit the rest of the work back and forth on the needles. Bind off at each neck edge every other row 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2 times. 
When the work measures 39-42 (46-48-50) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 32-34 (34-36-38) sts on smaller double pointed needles with marine; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and stockinette st, increasing 8-6 (10-12-12) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40 (44-48-50) sts. Inc 1 st each side of marker 18-20 (22-20-23) times:
Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: every 4th row 
= 76-80 (88-88-96) sts. When the work measures 21-24 (28-31-35) cm , knit Pattern 1 (centering the pattern on the sleeve) and then knit the rest with marine. When the work measures 27-30 (34-37-41) cm , knit 5 rows reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge (if you are not knitting steeks, omit seam allowance). Bind off.


Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the 4 steek sts on either side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread - the 1st seam 1/2 st from the marker thread and the 2nd seam 1/2 st from the 1st seam. Cut up between the machine seams for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. Sew the sleeves to the body as follows: alternately 1 st in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and 1 st in the stitch after the machine seam on the body. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance over the cut edge by hand. 
Pick up approx. 80-90 sts on smaller double pointed needles with marine around the neck; join and knit 2 cm  rib, 1 row red, bind off loosely with red.
