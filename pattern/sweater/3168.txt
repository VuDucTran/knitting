Pattern: See chart below (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette st. Arrows indicate the starting points for the sleeve («erme») and body («bol»). 

Body: The sweater is knit in the round with steeks cut for armholes. Cast on 130-138 (144-152-160) sts on smaller circular needles with natural; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 5 cm  rib, change to larger circular needles and Pattern (start at the «Bol» arrow), increasing 26-30 (36-40-44) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 156-168 (180-192-204) sts. When the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , increase 4 sts at each side for armhole steeks (these sts are not knit into the pattern - if you do not wish to cut steeks divide the work into two parts here and knit the rest of the front and back separately). When the work measures 36-39 (43-45-47) cm , bind off 28-28 (30-32-32) sts at the center front for the neck and knit the rest of the work back and forth on the needles. Bind off at each neck edge every other row 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2 times. When the work measures 39-42 (46-48-50) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 32-34 (34-36-38) sts on smaller double pointed needles with natural; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 4 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and Pattern (start at the «Erme» arrow), increasing 8-6 (10-12-12) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40 (44-48-50) sts. Inc 1 st each side of marker 18-20 (22-20-23) times: Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: every 4th row 
= 76-80 (88-88-96) sts. When the work measures 27-30 (34-37-41) cm , knit 5 rows reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge (if you are not knitting steeks, omit seam allowance). Bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the 4 steek sts on either side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread - the 1st seam ½ st from the marker thread and the 2nd seam ½ st from the 1st seam. Cut up between the machine seams for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. Sew the sleeves to the body as follows: alternately 1 st in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and 1 st in the stitch after the machine seam on the body. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance over the cut edge by hand. 
Pick up approx. 80-94 sts on smaller double pointed needles with natural around the neck; join and knit 3 cm  rib, bind off.
