Knitting tips (for raglan):
Dec as follows in each transition between sleeve, front and back (start 2 sts before the marker): K 2 tog, slip 1 st as if to knit, K 1, psso.

Knitting tip: If your row gauge is not correct, you will need to adjust. If your gauge is too tight, knit more rows between decs. If your gauge is too loose, make decs more frequently.

Body: Cast on 88-96-104-112-120 sts; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 2 rows garter st, then knit stockinette st – place a marker at each side.
When the piece measures 7-8-8-8-9 cm, P 1 row, then K 2 rows and P 1 row, then continue in stockinette st again.
When the piece measures 16 cm inc 1 st at each side of each marker = 92-100-108-116-124 sts.

Sleeve: Cast on 29-32-35-36-39 sts on double-pointed needles; join and place a marker at the join. K 1 row, P 1 row. Then knit stockinette st, decreasing 6-7-8-9-10 sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 23-25-27-27-29 sts.
When the piece measures 7 cm inc 1 st each side of marker every 6-7-6-5.5-6 cm a total of 5-5-6-7-7 times = 33-35-39-41-43 sts.
When sleeve measures 34-38-41-44-47 cm bind off 3-3-4-4-4 sts at each side of marker= 27-29-31-33-35 sts. Lay piece aside and knit 2nd sleeve.

Yoke: Put the sleeves in on the same circular needles as body where you bound off for armholes = 134-146-154-166-178 sts.
Put 1 marker in each transition between front, back and the sleeve (= 4 markers). Knit 1-1-1-1-0 row before beginning shaping.

Neck: When the piece measures 29-32-34-36-37 cm put the center front 12 sts on a st holder for the neck, then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 1-1-2-2-2 times.
