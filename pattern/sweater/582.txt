Back and front pieces: Cast on 112-124-136-144 (152-164-172-184) sts on circular needle size 3 mm with deep red and knit 8 rows garter st. Insert a marking thread each side. Change to circular needle size 4 mm and continue in stocking sts – remember the knitting tension! At the same time inc each side as follows: 
Sizes 6/9 - 12/18 months: No inc for these two sizes. 
Size 2 years: When piece measures 15 cm inc1 st on each side of both marking threads (= 4 new sts). 
Size 3/4 years: When piece measures 8 and 18 cm inc1 st on each side of both marking threads (= 8 new sts). 
Sizes 5/6- 7/8- 9/10- 11/12 years: When the piece measures 4 cm inc1 st on each side of both marking threads. Repeat the inc 5-5-6-6 times on every 5-6-5-5 cm (=  4 new sts per increase). 
Now there are 112-124-140-152 (172-184-196-208) sts on needle. When piece measures 19-22-26-28 (30-34-35-35) cm slip 8 sts each side on a thread for armhole (= 4 sts on each side of the marking thread) = 96-108-124-136 (156-168-180-192) sts on the needle. Put the piece aside and knit the sleeves.

Sleeve: Cast on 40-40-44-44 (48-48-52-52) sts on double pointed needles size 3 mm in deep red. Knit Rib - see explanation above - for 4-4-4-4 (5-5-5-5) cm. Change to double pointed needles size 4 mm and continue in stocking st. At the same time, inc 2 sts mid under arm: 4-6-4-8 (8-10-10-14) times on every 11-8-15-8 (9-8-9-6) rounds = 48-52-52-60 (64-68-72-80) sts. When piece measures 21-23-27-30 (33-37-40-42) cm slip 8 sts mid under arm on a thread = 40-44-44-52 (56-60-64-72) sts on needle.

Yoke: Slip the sleeves onto the same circular needle as the jersey where 8 sts has been put on the thread for armhole = 176-196-212-240 (268-288-308-336) sts on needle. 
Insert a marking thread in all transitions between sleeves and jersey = 4 marking threads.

Read all of the next section before knitting !
Continue in stocking sts, at the same time after 2-1-4-3 (3-3-3-3) rounds dec for raglan as follows:

Dec for raglan on both sides of all 4 marking threads = 8 decreases of 2 sts per round (= 16 sts dec per round). 
There are 4 stocking sts between each dec (i.e. 2 sts on each side of MT).
Dec 2 sts as follows from the RS:
start 5 sts before the marking threads: Slip 1 st as if to knit, K2 tog, psso, K2.
After the marking threads: K2, K3 tog. 

Note! After dec for neck the piece is finished back and forth on needle and dec are also made from thw WS.
Dec 2 sts as follows from the WS: 
start 5 sts before the marking threads: P3 tog into back of sts, P2.
After the marking threads: P2, P3 tog into back of st.

Dec as follows:
Size 6/9 - 12/18 months: 
Dec 2 sts each side of MT on every 4th round: 6-7 times. 

Size 2 - 3/4 (5/6- 7/8- 9/10- 11/12) years: 
Dec 2 sts each side of MT on every 4th round: 3-3 (3-3-2-1) times and then on every 3rd round 2 sts 5-7 (8-9-11-14) times.

At the same time when there are 6 rounds left of raglan dec, cast off for neck on front piece and for slit on back piece (for the 2 smallest sizes) as follows: Slip the middle 8-10-12-12 (14-16-18-18) sts on front on a thread for neck and finish the piece back and forth on needle.  At the same time (for the 2 smallest sizes) cast of the 2 middle sts on back piece for slit, cast on 3 new sts each side of the slit and knit these in garter sts until finished measurements. Continue slipping 2 sts on the thread at front to shape the neckline on every other row a total of 2 times. Now put all sts back on needle = 84-88-84-80 (92-96-100-96) sts. 
Change to double pointed needles size 3 mm and knit stocking sts – however, on the 2 smallest sizes knit back and forth from the slit mid back – at the same time dec 20-14-8-0 (10-8-8-0) sts evenly over the 1st round/row = 64-74-76-80 (82-88-92-96) sts. For the 2 smallest sizes: continue with 3 garter sts towards the slit mid back and cast off for 1 buttonhole after 0.5 cm and again after 2.5 cm - 1 button hole = cast off the middle of the 3 garter sts from RS and make a yo over the cast of st on the return row. When neck edge measures 3-3-3-3 (4-4-4-4) cm cast off – the neck will now roll.

Assembly: Sew the openings under the arms with mattress sts to ensure the seam becomes elastic. On the 2 smallest sizes sew the bottom of the slit and sew on the buttons.
