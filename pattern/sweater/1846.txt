Pattern: See chart. (1 chart = 1 repeat.) The pattern is seen from the right side.
Pattern 1: 1 row of chart = 2 rows garter st.
Pattern 2: 1 row of chart = 1 row stockinette st.

Garter st, when knitting flat: Knit all sts, all rows.

Buttonhole: Make buttonholes along appropriate button band. 1 buttonhole = bind off the 3rd and 4th sts from center front edge and cast on 2 new sts on on the next row.
Make buttonholes when the piece measures:

Size 9/10: 1, 9, 17, 25, 33 and 41 cm


Note on buttonbands: The buttonbands are knit in garter st with periwinkle only. In order to make a neat edge the bands should be knit at a little tighter gauge. It is best to knit the button bands on smaller double-pointed needles at the same time as knitting the body on larger circular needles.

Then bind off at neck edge every other row: 3 sts 1 time, 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 2-2-3-3 times = 15-17-18-20 sts remain. Bind off the remaining sts when the piece measures 39-42-45-48 cm
