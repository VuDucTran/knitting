1 ridge = 2 rounds. K 1 round and P 1 round.

YOKE:
Cast on 84-88-92-96-100 sts on a small circular needle size 3.5 mm with light pearl grey. Insert 1 marker at beg of round (= mid back). Work rib = K 2/P 2 for 3-3-4-4-5 cm (= neck edge). Switch to a short circular needle size 4 mm. K 1 round while at the same time adjusting no of sts to 78-84-90-98-105. Then work an elevation at the back in stocking st as follows: K 8 sts past marker, turn, tighten yarn and P 16 sts on return, turn, tighten yarn and K 24 sts, turn, continue by working 8 sts more on every turn until a total of 48-48-64-64-80 sts have been worked, turn and K 1 round until marker mid back again. Then work A.1 (= 13-14-15-14-15 repetitions in width) - see diagram for size. READ KNITTING TIP! REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION Switch to a longer circular needle when there are enough sts. When A.1 has been worked, there are 208-224-240-252-270 sts on needle. Work 0-0-1-0-1 cm with light pearl grey. Piece now measures approx. 15-15-16-17-18 cm mid front (measured without rib in the neck). Work with light pearl grey and in stocking st until finished measurements.

When piece measures 3 cm, inc as follows: Inc 1 st on each side of 1st and 4th marker, inc 1 st after 2nd and 5th marker and 1 st before 3rd and 6th marker – READ INCREASE TIP (= 8 sts inc). Inc every 2-2½-2½-3-3 cm 13-13-14-14-15 times in total = 240-248-264-272-288 sts. 
When piece measures 29-34-38-42-46 cm, dec 0-2-0-2-0 st evenly on round = 240-246-264-270-288 sts, then work according to A.2. When A.2 has been worked one time vertically, there are 280-287-308-315-336 sts on round. Work 2 RIDGES - see explanation above, and cast off.
