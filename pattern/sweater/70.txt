Gauge: 17 sts x 22 rows on larger needles in stockinette st = 10 x 10 cm.

Rib: * K 3, P 3 *, repeat * - *.

Note on the diagram: The shrug is knit from cuff to cuff. The diagram shows the shrug after assembly – that is, with the sleeve seam sewn. The dotted line indicates the center back – the sloping line indicates the front edge.

Right side: Loosely cast on 50-50-56-56-56 sts on larger needles. P 1 row (wrong side), then knit rib, keeping 1 edge st at each side in garter st. When the piece measures 12 cm dec all P 3 to P 2 = 42-42-47-47-47 sts. Continue the rib with K 3/P 2.
When the piece measures 18 cm K 1 row (right side row), then K 1 row (wrong side), adjusting (inc/dec as needed) to 42-42-46-48-48 sts, then continue in stockinette st.
When the piece measures 20-20-20-25-21 cm inc 1 st at each side every 3-2.5-2.5-2-2 cm a total of 12-14-14-15-17 times = 66-70-74-78-82 sts. After last inc the piece measures 53 cm, put 1 marker at each side – measure the piece from here.
Now dec at one side of piece (= front) at the same time cast on new sts at the other side of piece (= back) as follows:
At front edge: on 1st row bind off 3 sts, then bind off every other row: 3 sts 3 times and 2 sts 9-10-11-12-13 times, then every 4 rows: 1 st 3 times.
At back edge: inc every other row: 2 sts 3 times and 1 st 5-6-7-6-9 times, then every 4 rows: 1 st 4-4-4-5-4 times.
After all incs and decs there are 48-51-54-56-60 sts. When the piece measures 18-19-20-21-22 cm put 10 sts on a st holder from lower edge of back up toward the neck every other row 4 times = 8-11-14-16-20 sts remain on needles.
The shrug is now knit to the center back (halfway). Place a new marker at center back of neck. Knit 1 row stockinette st over all sts on needles, then knit the other half, reversing shaping as follows: put 10 sts back on needles every other row 4 times = 48-51-54-56-60 sts. When sts are put back on needles pick up 1 st between the last st on needles the first st on st holder, K tog this st with the first st on st holder. This prevents a hole where the sts are returned to the needles.
When the piece measures 5 cm from the marker in back of the neck inc/cast on for front (= the side of piece you previously bound off) every 4 rows: 1 st 3 times, then every other row: 2 sts 9-10-11-12-13 times and 3 sts 4 times.
At the same time, when the piece measures 8 cm from the marker in back of the neck dec for back (= the side you previously increased) every 4 rows: 1 st 4-4-4-5-4 times, then every other row: 1 st 5-6-7-6-9 times and 2 sts 3 times.
After all incs and decs are complete there are 66-70-74-78-82 sts. Put a marker at each side – measure the work from here.
Now dec 1 st at each side every 3-2.5-2.5-2-2 cm a total of 12-14-14-15-17 times = 42-42-46-48-48 sts. When the piece measures 34 cm P 1 row (right side) and P 1 row (wrong side), adjusting (inc/dec as needed) to 42-42-47-47-47 sts.
Now knit rib (= K 3/P 2) keeping 1 edge st at each side in garter st.
When cuff measures 6 cm from the P rows inc all P 2 to P 3 = 50-50-56-56-56 sts. When cuff measures 18 cm from the P rows K 1 row (right side) and then bind off loosely.

Assembly: Sew sleeve seams using edge sts as seam allowance, up to markers. Pick up sts around opening = 180-195-210-225-225 sts (divisible by 15) on smaller circular needles. If you pick up more or less sts, adjust on the 2nd row evenly distributed. Join and knit in the round as follows (seen from the right side): P 1 row and K 1 row, then knit rib (= K 3/P 2).
When edge measures 2 cm inc every 3rd P 2 to P 3 = 192-208-224-240-240 sts. Repeat inc when edge measures 5 and 8 cm, so that each P 2 is now P 3 = 216-234-252-270-270 sts. Bind off loosely in rib.

Right side: Loosely cast on 38-44-44-50-50 sts on larger needles.
P 1 row (wrong side), then continue in rib, keeping 1 edge st at each side in garter st. When the piece measures 6 cm dec all P 3 to P 2 = 32-37-37-42-42 sts. Continue the rib with K 3/P 2. When the piece measures 10 cm K 1 row (right side) and K 1 row (wrong side), decreasing evenly distributed to 28-30-32-32-34 sts, then continue in stockinette st. When the piece measures 13-14-13-15-15 cm inc 1 st at each side every 3-3-3.5-3-3 cm a total of 9-10-10-12-13 times = 46-50-52-56-60 sts. After last inc the piece measures approx. 37-41-45-48-51 cm, put 1 marker at each side – measure the piece from here.
Now dec at one side of piece (= front) at the same time cast on new sts at the other side of piece (= back) as follows:
At front edge: on 1st row bind off 3 sts, then bind off every other row: 2 sts 5-6-6-7-8 times and 1 st 10-10-11-11-11 times.
At back edge: inc every other row: 2 sts 2-3-4-5-5 times and then every 4 rows: 1 st 5-5-5-5-6 times.
After all decs and incs are complete there are 32-36-39-43-46 sts. When the piece measures 14-15-16-17-18 cm put sts onto a st holder from lower edge of back up toward the neck every other row: 8-9-10-11-11 sts 3 times = 8-9-9-10-13 sts remain on needles.
The shrug is now knit to the center back (halfway). Place a new marker at center back of neck. Knit 1 row stockinette st over all sts on needles, then knit the other half, reversing shaping as follows:
Put 8-9-10-11-11 sts back on needles every other row 3 times = 32-36-39-43-46 sts.
When sts are put back on needles pick up 1 st between the last st on needles the first st on st holder, K tog this st with the first st on st holder. This prevents a hole where the sts are returned to the needles.
When the piece measures 3 cm from the marker in back of the neck inc for front (= the side you previously bound off) every other row: 1 st 10-10-11-11-11 times, 2 sts 5-6-6-7-8 times and 3 sts 1 time. At the same time when the piece measures 6 cm from the marker in back of the neck dec for back (= the side you previously increased) every 4 rows: 1 st 5-5-5-5-6 times and then every other row: 2 sts 2-3-4-5-5 times.
After all incs and decs are complete 46-50-52-56-60 sts. Put 1 marker at each side – measure the piece from here.
Now dec 1 st at each side every 3-3-3.5-3-3 cm a total of 9-10-10-12-13 times = 28-30-32-32-34 sts. When the piece measures 26-30-34-37-40 cm, P 1 row (right side), then P 1 row (wrong side), increasing to 32-37-37-42-42 sts. Now knit rib (= K 3/ P 2), keeping 1 edge st at each side in garter st.
When cuff measures 4 cm from the P rows inc all P 2 to P 3 = 38-44-44-50-50 sts. When cuff measures 10 cm from the P rows P 1 row (wrong side) and then bind off loosely.

Assembly: Sew sleeve seams using edge sts as seam allowance, up to markers. Pick up sts around opening = 135-150-165-180-180 sts (divisible by 15) on smaller circular needles. If you pick up more or less sts, adjust on the 2nd row evenly distributed. Join and knit in the round as follows (seen from the right side): P 1 row and K 1 row, then knit rib (= K 3/P 2).
When edge measures 2 cm inc every 3rd P 2 to P 3 = 144-160-176-192-192 sts. Repeat inc when edge measures 5 and 8 cm, so that each P 2 is now P 3 = 162-180-198-216-216 sts. Bind off loosely in rib.
