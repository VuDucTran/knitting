Decreasing tips (for raglan):
ESKIMO:
From right side: Dec 1 st as follows in each transition between sleeve and front/back (start 4 sts before the marker): Sl 1 as if to knit, K 1, psso, K 4 (the marker is in the middle of these 4 sts), K 2 tog.
From wrong side: Start 4 sts before the marker, P 2 tog, P 4, P 2 tog, twisting sts (if this is too difficult, sl 2, return to left needle, twisting each, then P 2 tog).

HIGHLANDER:
From right side: Dec 1 st as follows in each transition between sleeve and front/back (start 4 sts before the marker): P 2 tog, twisting sts, K 4 (the marker is in the middle of these 4 sts, P 2 tog.
From wrong side: Start 4 sts before the marker, K 2 tog, P 4, sl 1 as if to knit, K 1, psso.

Raglan tips: If your row gauge is not accurate, your armhole will not be the correct length. If your gauge is too tight, the armhole will be too short. You can correct for this by knitting extra rows without decreasing.

Body: Cast on 96-104-112-120-128 sts on smaller circular needles with Eskimo or Highlander; join and place a marker at the join. Knit rib – see instructions above. When the piece measures 5-6-6-6-6 cm change to larger circular needles and stockinette st (Eskimo) or reverse stockinette st (Highlander) – read NOTE above. Put a second marker at side = 48-52-56-60-64 sts between markers.
When the piece measures 12 cm inc 1 st on each side of each marker every 6-10-10-10-10 cm a total of 3 times = (108) 116-124-132-140 sts.
When the piece measures 33-41-42-43-44 cm bind off 6 sts at each side for armhole (= 3 sts each side of each marker) = 48-52-56-60-64 sts on Front and Back. Lay piece aside and knit the sleeves.

Sleeve: Cast on 24-24-24-32-32 sts on smaller double pointed needles; join and place a marker at the join. K 2 rows, the knit rib for 6-7-7-7-7 cm. Change to larger double-pointed needles and stockinette st (Eskimo) or reverse stockinette st (Highlander). When the piece measures 10-9-9-12-12 cm inc 1 st each side of marker every 5-4.5-4-5.5-5 cm a total of 8-10-11-8-9 times = 40-44-46-48-50 sts. When piece measures 49-52-52-54-54 cm bind off 3 sts each side of marker = 34-38-40-42-44 sts. Lay piece aside and knit a second sleeve.

Yoke: Put the sleeves in on the same circular needle as body pieces where you bound off for armholes = 164-180-192-204-216 sts. Put a marker in each transition between sleeve and body = 4 markers. Knit 2-1-1-0-0 rows and then begin raglan shaping.
Read the entire section before knitting!
Raglan shaping: Read Raglan tips above. Dec 1 st inside 2 sts each side of marker - see Decreasing tips above: every other row 13-15-16-17-18 times.
Neck: When the piece measures 48-57-59-61-63 cm put the center 8-8-10-12-14 sts on a st holder. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 1 time. After all raglan and neck shaping is complete 46-46-48-50-52 sts remain.

Neckband (Eskimo): Pick up approx 14-20-20-20-20 sts (incl sts on st holder) on front neck and put all sts on smaller double-pointed needles = approx 60-72-72-72-72 sts. P 1 row from right side, then knit 4 rows stockinette st (= rolled edge), decreasing evenly distributed to 48-48-50-52-54 sts on 1st row. Bind off - to make the edge roll nicely, K 2 sts in approx every 5th st at the same time as binding off.

Neckband (Highlander): Pick up approx 14-20-20-20-20 sts (incl sts on st holder) on front neck and put all sts on smaller double-pointed needles = approx 60-72-72-72-72 sts. P 1 row from right side, then knit 1 row, decreasing evenly distributed to 48-48-50-52-54 sts. Then knit rib - see instructions above - for 12 cm and then bind off in rib.
