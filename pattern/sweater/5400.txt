Continue with diagram M.1 until finished measurements - see arrow for where to beg in your size (this is important to make the pattern pretty mid front). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! 
When piece measures 25-27-29-31-33 cm, work next round as follows: Cast off 3 sts for armhole, work 29-32-35-38-41 sts (= left front piece), cast off 2 sts for neck, work 29-32-35-38-41 sts (= right front piece), cast off 6 sts for armhole, work 60-66-72-78-84 sts (= back piece), cast off 3 sts for armhole, cut the thread.

When piece measures 36-39-42-45-48 cm, cast off the middle 20-20-22-22-24 sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. Then cast off on every row from neck: 1 st 2 times = 12-13-14-16-16 sts remain on shoulder. Cast off when piece measures approx. 38-41-44-47-50 cm.

When edge measures approx. 2-2½-2½-3-3 cm, cast off with K over K and P over P. Place the left part of neck edge over the right part and fasten in bottom edge with stitches.
