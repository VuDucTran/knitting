Pattern: See charts (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is shown from the right side. Patterns 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are knit entirely in stockinette stitch; Pattern 5 has cables and textured stitches. The charts for Patterns 1 and 3 have arrows indicating the starting point for different sizes; all other charts are identical for all sizes.

Border: Knit 3 cm stockinette stitch, knit the next row as follows: * K 2 tog, yarn over *, repeat from * - * (for the folding edge), 3 cm stockinette stitch.

Body: Knit the border back and forth on the needles and the cardigan in the round after the border - cut steeks for armholes and at the center front.
Cast on 237-255-273 (291-327-345) sts (including 2 edge sts) on smaller circular needles with coral and knit border - measure the work from the folding edge). Change to larger circular needles and inc 3 sts at the center front - these sts + edge sts = 5 sts are for the steeks and are not knitted into the pattern. Join and knit Pattern 1 once, starting at the appropriate arrow on the chart after the 5 steek sts at the center front. After Pattern 1, knit Pattern 2 once, then Pattern 3 once - start at the appropriate arrow after the 5 steek sts at the center front. After Pattern 3 repeat Pattern 4 until the work measures approximately 19-20-21 (21-22-23) cm - adjust for complete pattern.
Change to smaller circular needles and knit Pattern 5 with coral.
Change back to larger circular needles and knit Pattern 4 and at the same time dec 2 sts over each cable on the 1st row = 157-169-181 (193-217-229) sts + 5 steek sts. When the work measures 37-40-44 (45-46-49) cm, knit the next row as follows: 5 steek sts, 39-42-45 (48-54-57) sts for the front, inc 4 sts (armhole steek sts which are not knitted into the pattern), 79-85-91 (97-109-115) sts for the back, inc 4 sts (armhole steek sts which are not knitted into the pattern), 39-42-45 (48-54-57) sts for the front. When the work measures 38-42-47 (49-52-55) cm, repeat Pattern 6 to finished dimensions (approximately 14 cm  of the work remains). When the work measures 48-52-56 (58-61-64) cm , bind off the center front 22-22-24 (24-26-26) sts + the 5 steek sts for the neck. Continue to knit back and forth on needle. Then bind off at each neck edge every other row: 3 sts 1 time, 2 sts 1 time, 1 st 2 times. When the work measures 50-54-59 (61-64-67) cm [19.75" - 21.25" - 23.25" (24" - 25.25" -26-3/8"), bind off the center back 35-35-37 (37-39-39) sts for the neck. Then dec 1 st at each back neck edge on the next row. Bind off after Pattern 6 is complete. The work measures approximately 52-56-61 (63-66-69) cm.
Sleeves: Cast on 40-44-48 (48-52-52) sts on smaller double pointed needles with coral and knit border - measure the work from the folding edge). Change to larger double pointed needles and join. Knit Pattern 7 once and at the same time, when the work measures 3 cm , inc 1 st each side of marker 15-15-15 (18-20-20) times:
Size 3/4 years: every 4th row
Sizes 5/6 + 9/10 + 11/12 years: every 5th row
Sizes 7/8 + 13/14 years: alternately every 5th and 6th row
= 70-74-78 (84-92-92) sts. After Pattern 7 repeat Pattern 4 until the work measures approximately 17-21-25 (28-30-33) cm  - adjust for complete pattern (approximately 9 cm of the work remains). Then knit Pattern 8 once. The work measures approximately 26-30-34 (37-39-42) cm . Then knit 2 cm  reverse stockinette stitch for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body, bind off.

Assembly: Sew a marker thread in the center of the steek sts on either side and at the center front. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread, 1st seam = 1/2 stitch from the marker thread, 2nd seam = 1/2 stitch from first seam. Cut steeks for armholes and at the center front. Sew shoulder seams. Pick up approximately 95-105 sts along the left front on smaller needles with coral and knit border, bind off. Fold the edge over against the cut edge on the body and sew. Repeat along the right front, but after 1 cm make 5-6-6 (6-6-7) buttonholes evenly distributed on the row (1 buttonhole = bind off 2 sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on the next row). Remember to make corresponding buttonholes on the folding edge. Pick up approximately 90-110 sts around the neck on smaller needles with coral and knit border as follows: 2 cm stockinette stitch, change to wine red and knit 1 row stockinette stitch, next row as follows: * K 2 tog, yarn over *, repeat from * - * (for the folding edge), change back to coral and knit 2 cm stockinette stitch, bind off.
Sew the sleeves to the body from the right side as follows: sew alternately a stitch in the last row on the sleeve before the seam allowance and a stitch on the body after the machine seam. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance from the sleeve over the cut edge on the body by hand. Fold all edges over against the wrong side and sew. Sew on buttons.
