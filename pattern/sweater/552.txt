Color charts and updated retailer lists at www.garnstudio.comKnitting Tension: 21 sts x 28 rows on needle size 4 mm and stocking sts = 10 x 10 cm. Remember needle sizes are guidelines only!

Rib (neck): * K2, P2 *, repeat from *-*.

Pattern: See diagram, the entire pattern is knitted in stocking sts. 

Loop knit (on circular needles): The loops are made on the WS of the piece = Purl side. Loops can be knitted Large or Small (as illustrated on the picture) - see explanation below. 
Large loops:
1st round: Purl.
2nd round: * Make double loop as follows: Twist the yarn over and around the left second and third finger 3 times. Garter the next st by pulling all 3 threads on the left index finger through the st. Slip the loops off the finger – but the sts are still on the left needle, leave the main thread over the left index finger at the same time as 2 loops are held closely into the piece with the same finger. K 1 st in the back of the same st (= 1 twisted stocking st). There are now 3 loop sts + 1 twisted stocking st on the right needle. Lift the 3 back most sts over the first st = 1 loop st, k 1 *, repeat from *-*. 
3 rd. row: Purl. 
4th. row: *K1, 1 loop st (see explanation – 2nd round)*, repeat from *-*. 
Repeat 1st to 4th row continuously.
Small loops: Knit as explained for large loops. However, only twist the yarn over and around 1 finger (the index finger).

Back and Front piece: 
Piece is knitted in the round on a circular needle.
Cast on 144-156-168 (180-192) sts on circular needle size 4 mm in corn blue. Knit the loop pattern as explained above in the following colours: 1st and 2nd. round =, corn blue, 3rd and 4th round = light jeans blue, knit 2 rounds of corn blue (no loops on this stripe), knit loops again in the following colours: 1st and 2nd round = red-rose, 3rd and 4th round = light jeans blue.
Turn the piece so the loops are on the RS after the loop knitting (= 10 rounds in total). Continue in light jeans blue and pattern over all sts until finished measurement. Remember the knitting tension! When piece measures 29-32-34 (38-39) cm (remember to measure from the edge, not from the loops!) cast off for armhole as follows: Cast off 3 sts for armhole, knit 66-72-78 (84-90) sts over front piece, cast off 6 sts for armhole, 66-72-78 (84-90) sts over back piece, cast off 3 sts for armhole. Complete the front and back pieces separetely.

Front piece: = 66-72-78 (84-90) sts. Now cast off 2 sts each side for armhole on every other row: 3-3-3 (3-4) times and 1 st 2-2-2 (3-3) times = 50-56-62 (66-68) sts. When piece measures 37-41-44 (48-50) cm cast off 10-12-12 (14-16) sts mid front for neck and dec to shape the neckline on every other row: 2 sts 2 times and 1 st 2 times = 14-16-19 (20-20) sts left on each shoulder. Cast off when piece measures approx 41-45-48 (53-55) cm (adjust to pattern).

Back: = 66-72-78 (84-90) sts. Cast off for armhole as done for front piece. Continue until piece measures 40-44-47 (52-54) cm. Now, cast off the middle 18-20-20 (22-24) sts for neck and dec 2 sts on neckline on the next row = 14-16-19 (20-20) sts left on each shoulder. Cast off when piece measures approx 41-45-48 (53-55) cm (adjust to pattern).

Sleeve: Piece is knitted in the round on a circular needle.

Continue in light jeans blue and knit the 11 bottom rounds of the Pattern, thereafter complete the sleeve in light jeans blue. At the same time when piece measures 6 cm (remember to measure from the edge and not the loops!) inc 2 sts mid under arm 5-7-4 (5-8) times on every 10-9-17 (15-11) rounds = 46-50-56 (58-64) sts. When piece measures 26-30-33 (35.5-39.5) cm cast off 4 sts mid under arm and finish the sleeve back and forth on needle. Cast off each side on every other row: 2 sts 1-2-2 (3-3) times, 1 st 7-6-4 (5-5) times, 2 sts 2-2-4 (3-4) times. Cast off remaining sts, the sleeve measures approx 33-37-40 (43-48) cm.
