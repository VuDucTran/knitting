PATTERN: 
See diagrams A.1 to A.5. 

INCREASE TIP:
Increase 1 stitch by making 1 yarn over, on the next round, purl the yarn over twisted to prevent a hole.

RIDGE/GARTER STITCH (worked in the round):
1 ridge = 2 rounds. Knit 1 round and purl 1 round. 
----------------------------------------------------------

SKIRT:
The piece is worked in the round with circular needle, top down. 
Cast on 90-105-120-135-135-150 stitches with circular needle size 3.5 mm and Merino Extra Fine. Knit 1 round. The next round is worked as follows: * Knit 2, purl 2, knit 2, purl 2, knit 2, purl 1, knit 2, purl 2 *, work from *-* to end of round. Continue the rib in this way. When the piece measures 4-4-4-5-6-7 cm work a row of holes as follows: * Knit 2 together, 1 yarn over, purl 2, knit 2 together, 1 yarn over, purl 2, knit 2 together, 1 yarn over, purl 1, knit 2 together, 1 yarn over, purl 2 *, work from *-* to end of round. Continue with rib until the piece measures 8-9-9-11-13-15 cm. Change to circular needle size 4 mm. Insert 1 marker - THE PIECE IS NOW MEASURED FROM HERE!
Now work as follows: * Purl 6, A.1 (= 9 stitches) *, work from *-* to end of round (= 6-7-8-9-9-10 repeats of A.1). REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION!
Continue the pattern as follows: Work A.1 1-1-1-1-2-2 times in height, A.2 1-1-1-1-1-1 time in height, A.3 1-1-1-2-2-2 times in height, A.4 1-1-1-1-1-1 time in height and A.5 2-2-3-3-3-4 times in height. 
AT THE SAME TIME when the piece measures 3 cm increase 1 stitch at the beginning of every purl section (= 6-7-8-9-9-10 stitches increased). Increase in this way every 1½-1½-2-2-2-2 cm a total of 10-9-9-9-10-11 times, but increase alternately at the end and beginning of each purl section (i.e. the next time you increase, increase at the end of each purl section, then at the beginning of each purl section, etc.). When you have completed A.1 to A.5, there are 174-196-224-252-261-300 stitches on the needle. Continue with A.5 until the piece measures approx. 17-17-21-24-26-29 cm from the marker (or to desired length). Work 2 RIDGES over all stitches – see description above and cast off with knit. The whole skirt measures approx. 26-27-31-36-40-45 cm from the cast-on edge and down.

TIE CORD:
Cut 3 strands Merino Extra Fine of 3½ meters each. Twist them together until they begin to resist, fold the cord double and it will continue to twist on its own. Tie a knot in each end. Start mid front and thread the cord up and down through the row of holes. Tie a bow mid front.

CROCHET EDGE:
Crochet an edge at the bottom of the skirt with Merino Extra Fine and hook size 3.5 mm as follows: 1 double crochet in first stitch, * 3 chain stitches, 1 treble crochet in the first chain stitch worked, skip forwards approx. 1½ cm, work 1 double crochet in the next stitch *, work from *-* to end of round, finish with 1 slip stitch in the first double crochet.
