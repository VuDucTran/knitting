Knitting tips (for raglan shaping):
Dec 1 st as follows in each transition between sleeve, front and back (start 2 sts before the marker): K 2 tog, marker, slip 1 st as if to knit, K 1, psso.

Knitting tip: If your row gauge is too tight, the armhole and raglan will be too short. Adjust for this by knitting an extra row as needed without decs.

Body: Cast on 96-102-114-126-132 sts with Symphony; join and place a marker at the join. K 1 row, then P 1 row. Then knit stockinette st. Put a marker at the other side (48-51-57-63-66 sts between markers).
When the piece measures 7 cm inc 1 st at each side of each marker every 7 cm a total of 3 times = 108-114-126-138-144 sts.
When the piece measures 23-25-27-28-29 cm cast off 6-6-6-6-8 sts at each side for armhole (that is, 3-3-3-3-4 sts at each side of each marker) = 48-51-57-63-64 sts remain on front and back. Lay piece aside and knit the sleeve.

Long sleeve: Loosely cast on 36-38-40-40-42 sts on double-pointed needles; join and place a marker at the join. K 1 row, P 1 row. Then knit stockinette st. When the piece measures 3 and 6 cm dec 4 sts evenly distributed on the row = 28-30-32-32-34 sts. When the piece measures 10 cm inc 1 st each side of marker every 8-6.5-7.5-6.5-6 cm a total of 4-5-5-6-7 times = 36-40-42-44-48 sts.
When sleeve measures 36-39-43-46-48 cm dec 3-3-3-3-4 sts each side of marker = 30-34-36-38-40 sts. Lay piece aside and knit second 1 sleeve.

Short sleeve: Loosely cast on 32-34-34-36-40 sts on double-pointed needles; join and place a marker at the join. K 1 row, P 1 row. Then knit stockinette st, increasing 1 st each side of marker on the 1st row after purl row.
Continue to inc 1 st each side of marker every 2-2-2-2.5-3 cm a total of 1-2-3-3-3 times = 36-40-42-44-48 sts. When sleeve measures 5-7-9-11-12 cm bind off 3-3-3-3-4 sts each side of marker = 30-34-36-38-40 sts. Lay piece aside and knit second sleeve.

Yoke: Put the sleeves in on the same circular needles as Body where you bound off for armholes= 156-170-186-202-208 sts. Put 1 marker in each transition between Body and sleeves (= 4 markers). Knit 3-1-1-1-1 rows before beginning shaping.

Read the entire pattern before knitting further.
Raglan shaping: Dec 1 st at each side of each marker (= 8 decs per row). Dec every other row -- see knitting tips above: 9-11-12-13-14 times.

Neck: At the same time when the piece measures 33-36-39-40-42 cm put the center 16-17-17-17-18 sts on a st holder for the neck. Bind off at each neck edge every other row: 2 sts 2-2-2-1-1 time and 1 st 0-0-0-3-3 times.
After all raglan and neck shaping is complete 60-57-65-71-68 sts remain on needles.
Neckband: Pick up 22-30 sts on front neckline (incl. sts on st holder) with Symphony = approx. 79-101 sts. K 1 row (right side row), decreasing evenly distributed on the row to 49-54-54-58-61 sts. K 1 row, P 1 row, and bind off loosely.

Assembly: Sew opening under the sleeve.
Neck frill: Pick up approx. 49-54-54-58-61 sts from right side of bound-off edge of neck on double-pointed needles with Vivaldi; join and K 1 row (right side row). On the next row, * K 1, yo * around the entire row. On the next row, twist and K each yo from previous row = approx. 98-108-108-116-122 sts. Bind off all sts – but so that the bound-off edge will not be too tight, make and bind off a yo after every st.
Frill on lower edge of long sleeve: Pick up approx. 36-38-40-40-42 sts in cast-on edge of sleeves and knit frill in the same manner as neck. Have you made this or any other of our designs?
