Dec as follows before 4 edge sts in garter st: Beg 2 sts before the 4 edge sts and K 2 tog.

KNITTING TIP:
Because of ridges in garter st and weight of yarn the piece can become somewhat longer when worn. To avoid the armhole from becoming too long you can crochet an edge around the armhole at the end.
----------------------------------------------------------

VEST:
Work piece in 3 parts, bottom up, up to after vent, then work body back and forth from mid front before dividing piece at the armhole and finish each part separately.

RIGHT FRONT PIECE:
Cast on 30-33-35 (38-40-42) sts (incl 4 band sts towards mid front) on circular needle size 3 mm with Baby Merino. Work in GARTER ST back and forth on needle - see explanation above but P the 4 edge sts towards mid front on every row (= band). When piece measures 4-4-4 (6-6-6) cm – adjust so that last row is from WS, put piece aside. 

LEFT FRONT PIECE:
Cast on and work as right front piece but reversed. In addition dec for BUTTON HOLES on band - see explanation above! When left front piece is the same length as right front piece - adjust so that last row is from WS, put piece aside.

BACK PIECE: 
Cast on 52-58-62 (68-72-76) sts on circular needle size 3 mm with Baby Merino. Work in garter st back and forth until back piece is the same length as both front pieces - adjust so that last row is from WS.

BODY:
Beg from RS and work sts from right front piece (remember to P band sts on every row until finished measurements), work sts from back piece and then sts from left front piece (remember to P band sts on every row until finished measurements) = 112-124-132 (144-152-160) sts on needle. Continue to work in garter st back and forth and P bands on every row. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION and remember to dec for BUTTONHOLES on left band. When piece measures 17-18-19 (20-22-24) cm, work next row from RS as follows: Work 27-30-32 (35-37-39) sts as before (= right front piece), cast off 6 sts for armhole, work 46-52-56 (62-66-70) sts as before (= back piece), cast off 6 sts for armhole and work the remaining 27-30-32 (35-37-39) sts as before (= left front piece). Finish each part separately.

BACK PIECE: 
= 46-52-56 (62-66-70) sts. Continue to work in garter st back and forth on needle. AT THE SAME TIME on first row from RS, dec 1 st in each side for armholes - Read DECREASE TIP! Repeat dec in each side every 4th row (i.e. every other row from RS) 4 times in total = 38-44-48 (54-58-62) sts. Continue in garter st. When piece measures 23-25-27 (29-32-35) cm, cast off the middle 16-16-18 (20-20-20) sts for neck and finish each shoulder separately. On next row from RS dec 1 st for neck - READ DECREASE TIP.

RIGHT FRONT PIECE:
= 27-30-32 (35-37-39) sts. Continue back and forth as before while AT THE SAME TIME cast off for armhole in the side as on back piece. AT THE SAME TIME when piece measures 18-19-20 (21-23-25) cm, dec 1 st for V-neck towards mid front - READ DECREASE TIP. Repeat dec every other row 14 times in all sizes and then every 4th row 0-0-1 (2-2-2) times in total. After all dec for armhole and V-neck, 9-12-13 (15-17-19) sts remain on needle. Continue until piece measures 25-27-29 (31-34-37) cm and cast off.

----------------------------------------------------------
KNEE PANTS:

GARTER ST (back and forth):

----------------------------------------------------------

KNEE PANTS:
Worked in the round from the waist down.
Cast on 104-112-128 (136-144-152) sts on circular needle size 2.5 mm with Baby Merino - beg of round = mid back. Work rib as follows: K 1, * P 2, K 2 *, repeat from *-* until 3 sts remain and finish with P 2 and K 1. When rib measures 2 cm, work an eyelet row as follows: K 1, * P 2 tog, 1 YO, K 2 *, repeat from *-* until 3 sts remain, finish with P 2 tog, 1 YO and K 1. Continue to work until rib measures 3-3-3 (4-4-4) cm. Switch to circular needle size 3 mm and K 1 round while AT THE SAME TIME inc 20-22-16 (18-20-20) sts evenly = 124-134-144 (154-164-172) sts. 
ELEVATION AT THE BACK: Now work the pants higher at the back. Work in stocking st back and forth as follows: Beg mid back and K 6-6-7 (7-8-8), turn piece (to avoid holes, slip 1st st on return and tighten yarn). P 12-12-14 (14-16-16), turn piece. K 18-18-21 (21-24-24), turn piece. P 24-24-28 (28-32-32), turn piece. Continue like this by working 6-6-7 (7-8-8) sts more on every turn 6 more times (= 10 short rows in total). Then continue in stocking st in the round over all sts.
INCREASES: When piece measures 10-13-14 (15-16-18) cm from the waist (measured mid front), insert 1 marker at the beg of round and 1 marker after 62-67-72 (77-82-86) sts (marks mid front and mid back of pants). Then inc 1 st on each side of all these markers – READ INCREASE TIP (= 4 sts inc). Repeat inc on every 3rd round a total of 5 times = 144-154-164 (174-184-192) sts. After last inc piece measures approx. 14-17-18 (19-20-22) cm from the waist (measures mid front).

LEG: 
Beg mid back, work the first 72-77-82 (87-92-96) sts and slip the other sts on 1 stitch holder. Switch to double pointed needles size 3 mm and work in stocking st in the round. Insert 1 marker at beg of round = inside of leg. When 1 cm has been worked, dec 1 st on each side of marker – SEE DECREASE TIP (= 2 sts dec). Repeat dec every 2nd-2nd-4th (6th-8th-8th) round 7 times in total in all sizes = 58-63-68 (73-78-82) sts. 
When leg measures 5-6-10 (14-16-18) cm (last dec should be done), K 1 round while dec 8-9-8 (9-8-8) sts evenly = 50-54-60 (64-70-74) sts. Cut the yarn.

EDGE IN GARTER ST:
Beg from RS on the side on right leg (i.e. 25-27-30 (32-35-37) sts after inside of leg). Switch to circular needle size 2.5 mm, work in GARTER ST back and forth – see explanation above and cast on 6 new sts at the end of first row from WS = 56-60-66 (70-76-80) sts on needle. When edge in garter st measures 1 cm, dec for 1 buttonhole at beg of row (seen from RS, i.e. where new sts were cast on) as follows: K tog third and fourth from edge and make 1 YO. When edge in garter st measures 2 cm, loosely cast off. 

Work the other leg the same way but reversed. 
Pants measures approx. 21-25-30 (35-38-42) cm from waist and down (measured mid front). 
Sew 1 button on edge in garter st at the bottom of each leg - place button to desired leg width.

TIES:

Switch to red and work in stocking st in the round AT THE SAME TIME dec for toes on each side of both markers - SEE DECREASE TIP! Repeat dec every other round 0-0-0 (0-5-5) times and then every round 7-7-8 (8-3-3) times in total = 8-10-8 (8-10-10) sts remain on needle.
