Rib: * K 1, P 1 *, repeat from * - *. 

Garter st, when knitting flat: Knit all sts, all rows.

Pattern: 
Row 1: K all sts 
Row 2: * K 1, P 1 *. Repeat from * - *.

Pocket lining: Cast on 30 sts on larger needles with brown and knit 10 cm  stockinette st, purl 1 row (= folding edge), K 10 cm  stockinette st, put sts on a stitch holder. Knit 2 of these. 

Body: First knit pocket linings. Numbers in ( ) = men’s sizes. Cast on 267-283 (271-287-299-311) sts on smaller circular needles and knit rib for 5-5 (6-6-6-6) cm , keeping the 11 sts at each edge in garter st for the buttonbands throughout. When the rib measures 2 cm , make a buttonhole on the appropriate side as follows: bind off the 6th and 7th sts and cast on 2 new sts over the bound-off sts on the next row. When the rib measures 5-5 (6-6-6-6) cm , put the 11 buttonband sts on each side on a stitch holder, change to larger circular needles and knit Pattern, increasing 1 st on each edge (center front) for seam - knit this st in garter st throughout = 247-263 (251-267-279-291) sts. When the work measures 15-15 (16-16-16-16) cm , knit the next row as follows: 1 edge st, 12 sts pattern, put 30 sts on a stitch holder for pocket, 161-177 (165-181-193-205) sts pattern, put 30 sts on a stitch holder for pocket, 12 sts pattern, 1 edge st. 
On the next row, put the pocket lining in on the needles in the opening over the 30 sts on the stitch holder. Continue with Pattern. 
When the work measures 34-37 (39-40-41-43) cm  knit the next row as follows: 58-62 (59-63-66-69) sts for the front, bind off 8 sts for armhole, 115-123 (117-125-131-137) sts for the back, bind off 8 sts for armhole, 58-62 (59-63-66-69) sts for the front. Put the work aside.

Sizes S/M (S/M): alternately every 4th and 5th row
Sizes M/L (M/L + XL + XXL): every 4th row 
= 100-106 (106-110-110-112) sts - knit the increased sts into the Pattern as you go along. When the work measures 45-45 (49-50-49-49) cm , bind off 4 sts each side of marker = 92-98 (98-102-102-104) sts. Put the work aside. 

Body: Put the sleeves in on the same circular needles as the body where 8 sts are bound off = 415-443 (431-455-467-483) sts on needles. Attach a marker in each transition between the sleeves and the body (4 markers). Continue Pattern, but knit 1 st on each side of each marker in stockinette st (2 sts stockinette st in each transition between body and sleeve).

Raglan shaping: Read the entire next section before knitting!

Dec 1 st each side of the 2 transition stockinette sts every other row 31-30 (31-31-35-37) times, then every row 11-15 (13-16-13-12) times (8 sts decreased per row).

Make decreases as follows:
Before the 2 transition sts:
Right side: K 2 tog. 
Wrong side: Lift 2 sts off the needles, put them back on the left needle twisted (one by one), P 2 tog into the back of the st. 
After the 2 transition sts:
Right side: Slip 1, K 1, pass the slipped st over (psso). 
Wrong side: P 2 tog.

At the same time as the raglan shaping, shape the neck at each front edge. When the work measures 44-46 (49-50-51-53) cm , bind off for the neck every other row: 2 sts 2 times, 1 st 8-7 (5-6-7-9) times, then every 4th row: 1 st 3-4 (4-4-5-5) times, and then every 6th row: 1 st 1-2 (2-2-2-2) times. 

After the last raglan decrease the work measures approx. 60-64 (65.5-68-70.5-73.5) cm  -- 47-49 (49-47-47-51) sts remain on the needles. Bind off. The cardigan’s measurement up to the shoulder = 62-66 (68-70-72-75) cm .
