When piece measures 34 (40-43) cm place the middle 5 (5-6) stitches on a thread for neck. Then decrease towards neck every 2nd row: 1 stitch x 3 (3-3). Cast off when piece measures 39 (45-49) cm.

Back piece: Cast on and work as for front piece. Do not decrease for neck but the stitches for neck = 11 (11-12), are placed on a thread when piece measures 39 (45-49) cm. Cast off shoulder stitches.

Sleeve: Cast on 14 (15-16) stitches with circular needle size 8 mm and double strand of orange/tweed, continue with single strand. Work 1 ridge, then stocking stitch. Continue by increasing in each side: 1 stitch x 3 (4-5) every 8 (8-8) cm. When piece measures 31 (40-45) cm decrease for sleeve cap in each side every 2nd row: 1 stitch x 1, then 2 stitches in each side until piece measures 36 (45-50) cm. Cast off.

Assembly: Sew right shoulder seam. Knit up approx. 22 (22-24) stitches with circular needle size 8 mm and orange/tweed and work 5 (5-6) cm stocking stitch back and forth on needle, but work garter stitch over the outermost stitch in each side. Finish with 1 ridge and then cast off with double strand. Sew the left shoulder seam. Crochet 4 chain stitches at the neckline’s front piece side for button-loop with hook size 5 mm. Sew button onto neckline’s back piece side. Sew sleeve seams together with black yarn in outermost loop of edge stitches. Sew side seams in the same way and sew in sleeves.
