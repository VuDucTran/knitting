Rib: * K 1 into back of st, P 1 st *

Pattern: See charts below (1 chart = 1 repeat). The pattern is seen from the right side and is knit entirely in stockinette st. 

Body: The sweater is knit in the round with steeks cut for armholes. Cast on 130-138 (144-152-160) sts on smaller circular needles with blue; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 5 cm  rib, change to larger circular needles and stockinette st, increasing 26-30 (36-40-44) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 156-168 (180-192-204) sts. 
When the work measures 6-7 (10-12-13) cm , knit Pattern 1, centering the pattern across the front. When the work measures 21-23 (25-27-27) cm , inc 4 sts at each side for armholes (these sts are for the steeks and are not knit into the pattern - if you do not wish to cut steeks for armholes divide the work into two parts here and knit the rest of the front and back separately). 
After Pattern 1 knit 1-2 (3-3-4) cm  blue, then Pattern 2 once, then knit the rest with blue. At the same time, when the work measures 36-39 (43-45-47) cm , bind off 28-28 (30-32-32) sts at the center front for the neck and knit the rest of the work back and forth on the needles. Bind off at each neck edge every other row: 2 sts 1 time and 1 st 2 times. At the same time, when the work measures, 39-42 (46-48-50) cm .

Sleeves: Cast on 32-34 (34-36-38) sts on smaller double pointed needles with blue; join and place a marker at the join. Knit 5 cm  rib. Change to larger double pointed needles and stockinette st, increasing 8-6 (10-12-12) sts evenly distributed on the 1st row = 40-40 (44-48-50) sts. After 4 rows blue, knit Pattern 3 (center the pattern on the sleeve). Inc 1 st each side of marker 18-20 (22-20-23) times: Sizes 3/4 + 5/6 + 7/8: every 3rd row 
Sizes 9/10 + 11/12: every 4th row 
= 76-80 (88-88-96) sts. 
After Pattern 3 knit with blue until the work measures 20.5-23.5 (27.5-30.5-34.5) cm . Knit Pattern 2 (center the pattern on the sleeve) and then knit the rest with blue. When the work measures 27-30 (34-37-41) cm , knit 5 rows reverse stockinette st for a seam allowance over the cut edge on the body. (If you are not cutting armhole steeks, omit the seam allowance.) Bind off.


Assembly: Sew a marker thread down into the 4 steek sts on either side. Sew two machine seams around the marker thread - the 1st seam 1/2 st from the marker thread and the 2nd seam 1/2 st from the 1st seam. Cut up between the machine seams for armholes. Sew shoulder seams. Sew the sleeves to the body as follows: alternately 1 stitch in the last row of knitting on the sleeve before the seam allowance and 1 stitch in the stitch after the machine seam on the body. Turn the sweater inside out and sew the seam allowance on the sleeve over the cut edge by hand. 
Pick up approx. 80-90 sts on smaller double pointed needles with blue around the neck and knit 2 cm  rib, 1 row turquoise, bind off loosely with turquoise.
